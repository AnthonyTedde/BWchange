	abstract = {Metabolic markers are the core of metabonomic surveys. Hence selection of differential metabolites is of great importance for either biological or clinical purpose. Here, a feature selection method was developed for complex metabonomic data set. As an effective tool for metabonomics data analysis, support vector machine (SVM) was employed as the basic classifier. To find out meaningful features effectively, support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) was firstly applied. Then, genetic algorithm (GA) and random forest (RF) which consider the interaction among the metabolites and independent performance of each metabolite in all samples, respectively, were used to obtain more informative metabolic difference and avoid the risk of false positive. A data set from plasma metabonomics study of rat liver diseases developed from hepatitis, cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma was applied for the validation of the method. Besides the good classification results for 3 kinds of liver diseases, 31 important metabolites including lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) C16:0, palmitoylcarnitine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPC) C18:0 were also selected for further studies. A better complementary effect of the three feature selection methods could be seen from the current results. The combinational method also represented more differential metabolites and provided more metabolic information for a “global” understanding of diseases than any single method. Further more, this method is also suitable for other complex biological data sets.},

Early chatter detection is a prerequisite for taking effective measures to avoid chatter. However, there are still many difficulties in the feature extraction of chatter detection. In this article, a novel online chatter detection method in end milling process is proposed based on wavelet packet transform (WPT) and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVMRFE). The measured vibration signal in the machining process was preprocessed by WPT. The original feature set of chatter composed of ten time-domain and four frequency-domain feature parameters was obtained via calculating the reconstructed signal. Then feature weights are computed by SVM-RFE, and the obtained feature ranking list was to indicate their different importance in chatter. The optimal feature subset was selected according to the prediction accuracy. The proposed method is described and applied to incipient chatter over conventional methods in identifying the transition from a stable to unstable state. Some milling tests were conducted and the experiment results was shown that the impulse factor and onestep autocorrelation function were the sensitive chatter features.},

Methods: 1800 Raman spectra were acquired from fresh samples of human breast tissues (normal, fibroadenoma, adenosis, galactoma, and invasive ductal carcinoma) from 168 patients. After set up the SVM-RFE and PCA models, Mahalanobis distance, spectral residuals, sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) were used as the discriminating criteria for evaluating these two methods. Results: The comparison shows that SVM-RFE based on the selection of characteristic peaks better reflects the nature of biopsy and it produces better discrimination, sensitivity, specificity, and MCC for normal (1, 1, 1), malignant (0.93, 0.97, 0.91), and benign (0.95, 0.97, 0.91) breast tissues. Conclusions: The Raman spectroscopy combined with SVM-RFE opens great future in the clinical applications of mammary disease diagnosis.},

Then we proposed partial least squares (PLS) based feature selection methods for HDSS and two theorems. The proposed methodologies include a PLS model for classiﬁcation, parameter selection, PLSRanking, and PLS-based recursive feature elimination. Furthermore, we compared our proposed methods with several existing feature selection methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) based feature selection, SVM-based recursive feature elimination (SVMRFE), Random Forest (RF) based feature selection, RF-based recursive feature elimination (RFRFE), ReliefF algorithm and ReliefF-based recursive feature elimination (ReliefFRFE). Using twelve high-dimensional datasets from different areas of research, we evaluated the results in terms of accuracy (sensitivity and speciﬁcity), running time, and the feature subset consistency and compactness. The analysis demonstrated that the proposed approach from our research performed very well when handling both two-category and multi-category problems.},

In order to compare the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, we also present PLS-based GlobalRFE which takes all categories into consideration simultaneously. The advantage of the proposed algorithms lies in the fact that PLS-based feature ranking can quickly delete irrelevant features and RFE can concurrently remove some redundant features. As a result, the selected feature subset is more compact. In this paper the proposed algorithms are compared to some state-of-the-art methods using multiple datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are competitive and work effectively for high-dimensional multi-category data. Statistical tests of signiﬁcance show that LRFEPLS algorithm has better performance. The proposed algorithms can be effectively applied not only to microarray data analysis but also to image recognition and ﬁnancial data analysis.},

	abstract = {Support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) is a powerful feature selection algorithm. However, when the candidate feature set contains highly correlated features, the ranking criterion of SVM-RFE will be biased, which would hinder the application of SVM-RFE on gas sensor data. In this paper, the linear and nonlinear SVM-RFE algorithms are studied. After investigating the correlation bias, an improved algorithm SVM-RFE+CBR is proposed by incorporating the correlation bias reduction (CBR) strategy into the feature elimination procedure. Experiments are conducted on a synthetic dataset and two breath analysis datasets, one of which contains temperature modulated sensors. Large and comprehensive sets of transient features are extracted from the sensor responses. The classification accuracy with feature selection proves the efficacy of the proposed SVM-RFE+CBR. It outperforms the original SVM-RFE and other typical algorithms. An ensemble method is further studied to improve the stability of the proposed method. By statistically analyzing the features’ rankings, some knowledge is obtained, which can guide future design of e-noses and feature extraction algorithms.},

	abstract = {Calculating derivatives of spectral data by the Savitzky?Golay (SG) numerical algorithm is often used as a preliminary preprocessing step to resolve overlapping signals, enhance signal properties, and suppress unwanted spectral features that arise due to nonideal instrument and sample properties. Addressing these issues, a study of the simulated and measured infrared data by partial least-squares regression has been conducted. The simulated data sets were modeled by considering a range of undesired chemical and physical spectral anomalies and variations that can occur in a measured spectrum, such as baseline variations, noise, and scattering effects. The study has demonstrated the importance of the optimization of the SG parameters during the conversion of spectra into derivative form, specifically window size and polynomial order of the fitting curve. A specific optimal window size is associated with an exact component of the system being estimated, and this window size does not necessarily apply for some other component present in the system. Since the optimization procedure can be time-consuming, as a rough guideline spectral noise level can be used for assessment of window size. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that, when the extended multiplicative signal correction (EMSC) is used alongside the SG procedure, the derivative treatment of data by the SG algorithm must precede the EMSC normalization.},

Today the range of applications has extended even further to include numerical methods, stochastic control, and insider trading, not just for systems driven by Brownian motion, but for systems driven by general Lévy processes.

Second, it makes it possible to obtain an extension of the Clark— Ocone formula from D1,2 to L2(P). Moreover, it provides a natural platform for the Wick product, which is closely related to Skorohod integration (see (5.28)). For example, we shall see that the Wick calculus can be used to simplify the computation of these integrals considerably. The Wick product was introduced by C.G. Wick in 1950 [226] as a renor-malization technique in quantum physics. In stochastic analysis this concept, or rather a relative of it, was introduced by Hida and Ikeda in 1967 [101]. In 1989, Meyer and Yan [165] extended the construction to cover Wick products of stochastic distributions (Hida distributions), including the white noise.},

Systems in motion but also systems in a state of balance or equilibrium can only be completely characterized when directional dependencies are considered. The complete characterization of a system is therefore achieved by quantities that describe both direction and magnitude. These are vector-valued functions which vary with respect to specified independent variables. A force acting on an object is an example of a vector-valued function, as is the object’s response in terms of its velocity of motion. Another example, this time of a distributed character, is the flow field of a fluid continuum.},

The fourth technique employs three integrals to sum the volume of an object. We start with the slicing technique.},

Differential Calculus is used for computing a function’s rate of change relative to one of its arguments. Generally, one begins with a function such as f(x), and as x changes, a corresponding change occurs in f(x). Differentiating f(x) with respect to x, produces a second function {\textbackslash}(f'(x){\textbackslash}), which gives the rate of change of f(x) for any x. For example, and without explaining why, if {\textbackslash}(f(x)=x{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}), then {\textbackslash}(f'(x)=2x{\textbackslash}), and when {\textbackslash}(x=3{\textbackslash}), f(x) is changing {\textbackslash}(2{\textbackslash}times 3=6{\textbackslash}) times faster than x.

Examples include: the number of alpha particles emitted from a source of radiation in a given time; the number of cases of leukemia reported per year in a certain jurisdiction; the number of flaws per metre of electrical cable. This chapter is concerned with counts when the individual events being counted are independent, or nearly so, and where there is no clear upper limit for the number of events that can occur, or where the upper limit is very much greater than any of the actual counts. We first compile important information about the Poisson distribution, the distribution most often used with count data. Poisson regression, or models for count data described by covariates, has already been covered elsewhere. We then focus on describing models for rates and models for counts organized in tables. Overdispersion is then discussed, including a discussion negative binomial glms and quasi-Poisson models as alternative models.},

	abstract = {As the previous two chapters have demonstrated, the process of building a linear regression model, or any regression model, is aided by exploratory plots of the data, by reflecting on the experimental design, and by considering the scientific relationships between the variables. This process should ensure that the model is broadly appropriate for the data. Once a candidate model has been fitted to the data, however, there are specialist measures and plots that can examine the model assumptions and diagnose possible problems in greater detail. This chapter describes these tools for detecting and highlighting violations of assumptions in linear regression models. The chapter goes on to discuss some possible courses of action that might alleviate the identified problems. The process of examining and identifying possible violations of model assumptions is called diagnostic analysis. The assumptions of linear regression models are first reviewed (Sect. 3.2), then residuals, the main tools of diagnostic analysis, are defined (Sect. 3.3). We follow with a discussion of the leverage, a measure of the location of an observation relative to the average observation location (Sect. 3.4). The various diagnostic tools for checking the model assumptions are then introduced (Sect. 3.5) followed by techniques for identifying unusual and influential observations (Sect. 3.6). The terminology of residuals is summarized in Sect. 3.7. Techniques for fixing any weaknesses in the models are summarised in Sect. 3.8, and explained in greater detail in Sects. 3.9 to 3.13. Finally, the issue of collinearity is discussed (Sect. 3.14).},

We first define linear regression models and introduce the relevant notation and assumptions. We then describe least-squares estimation for simple linear regression models and multiple regression models. The use of the R functions to fit linear regression models is explained, followed by a discussion of the interpretation of linear regression models. Inference procedures are developed for the regression coefficients, followed by analysis of variance methods. We then discuss methods for comparing nested models, and for comparing non-nested models. Tools to assist in model selection are then described.},

	abstract = {The previous chapter defined glms and studied the components of a glm. This chapter discusses the estimation of the unknown parameters in the glm: the regression parameters and possibly the dispersion parameter ϕ. Because glms assume a specific probability distribution for the responses from the edm family, maximum likelihood estimation procedures are used for parameter estimation, and general formulae are developed for the glm context. We first derive the score equations and information for the glm context, which are used to form algorithms for estimating the regression parameters for glms. The residual deviance is then defined as a measure of the residual variability across n observations after fitting the model. The standard errors of the regression parameters are developed and matrix formulations are used to estimate the regression parameters. We then explore the important connection between the algorithms for fitting linear regression models and glms. Techniques are then developed for estimating ϕ We conclude with a discussion of using r to fit glms.},

One particular type of statistical model—the generalized linear model—is the focus of this book, and so we begin with an introduction to statistical models in general. This allows us to introduce the necessary language, notation, and other important issues. We first discuss conventions for describing data mathematically (Sect. 1.2). We then highlight the importance of plotting data (Sect. 1.3), and explain how to numerically code non-numerical variables (Sect. 1.4) so that they can be used in mathematical models. We then introduce the two components of a statistical model used for understanding data (Sect. 1.5): the systematic and random components. The class of regression models is then introduced (Sect. 1.6), which includes all models in this book. Model interpretation is then considered (Sect. 1.7), followed by comparing physical models and statistical models (Sect. 1.8) to highlight the similarities and differences. The purpose of a statistical model is then given (Sect. 1.9), followed by a description of the two criteria for evaluating statistical models: accuracy and parsimony (Sect. 1.10). The importance of understanding the limitations of statistical models is then addressed (Sect. 1.11), including the differences between observational and experimental data. The generalizability of models is then discussed (Sect. 1.12). Finally, we make some introductory comments about using r for statistical modelling (Sect. 1.13).},

We first review the two components of a glm (Sect. 5.2) then discuss in greater detail the family of distributions upon which the random component is based (Sect. 5.3), including writing the probability functions in the useful dispersion model form (Sect. 5.4). The systematic component of the glm is then considered in greater detail (Sect. 5.5). Having discussed the two components of the glm, glms are then formally defined (Sect. 5.6), and the important concept of the deviance function is introduced (Sect. 5.7).

	abstract = {Very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest advances in image recognition performance in recent years. One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question of whether there are any benefit in combining the Inception architecture with residual connections. Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4, we achieve 3.08 percent top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the phenotypic and genetic variability of production traits and milk fatty acid (FA) contents throughout lactation. Genetic parameters for milk, fat, and protein yields, fat and protein contents, and 19 groups and individual FA contents in milk were estimated for first-parity Holstein cows in the Walloon Region of Belgium using single-trait, test-day animal models and random regressions. Data included 130,285 records from 26,166 cows in 531 herds. Heritabilities indicated that de novo synthesized FA were under stronger genetic control than FA originating from the diet and from body fat mobilization. Estimates for saturated short- and medium-chain individual FA ranged from 0.35 for C4:0 to 0.44 for C8:0, whereas those for monounsaturated long-chain individual FA were lower (around 0.18). Moreover, de novo synthesized FA were more heritable in mid to late lactation. Approximate daily genetic correlations among traits were calculated as correlations between daily breeding values for days in milk between 5 and 305. Averaged daily genetic correlations between milk yield and FA contents did not vary strongly among FA (around −0.35) but they varied strongly across days in milk, especially in early lactation. Results indicate that cows selected for high milk yield in early lactation would have lower de novo synthesized FA contents in milk but a slightly higher content of C18:1 cis-9, indicating that such cows might mobilize body fat reserves. Genetic correlations among FA emphasized the combination of FA according to their origin: contents in milk of de novo FA were highly correlated with each other (from 0.64 to 0.99). Results also showed that genetic correlations between C18:1 cis-9 and other FA varied strongly during the first 100 d in milk and reinforced the statement that the release of long-chain FA inhibits FA synthesis in the mammary gland while the cow is in negative energy balance. Finally, results showed that the FA profile in milk changed during the lactation phenotypically and genetically, emphasizing the relationship between the physiological status of cow and milk composition.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Increasing consumer concern exists over the relationship between food composition and human health. Because of the known effects of fatty acids on human health, the development of a quick, inexpensive, and accurate method to directly quantify the fatty acid (FA) composition in milk would be valuable for milk processors to develop a payment system for milk pertinent to their customer requirements and for farmers to adapt their feeding systems and breeding strategies accordingly. The aim of this study was (1) to confirm the ability of mid-infrared spectrometry (MIR) to quantify individual FA content in milk by using an innovative procedure of sampling (i.e., samples were collected from cows belonging to different breeds, different countries, and in different production systems); (2) to compare 6 mathematical methods to develop robust calibration equations for predicting the contents of individual FA in milk; and (3) to test interest in using the FA equations developed in milk as basis to predict FA content in fat without corrections for the slope and the bias of the developed equations. In total, 517 samples selected based on their spectral variability in 3 countries (Belgium, Ireland, and United Kingdom) from various breeds, cows, and production systems were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). The samples presenting the largest spectral variability were used to calibrate the prediction of FA by MIR. The remaining samples were used to externally validate the 28 FA equations developed. The 6 methods were (1) partial least squares regression (PLS); (2) PLS+repeatability file (REP); (3) first derivative of spectral data+PLS; (4) first derivative+REP+PLS; (5) second derivative of spectral data+PLS; and (6) second derivative+REP+PLS. Methods were compared on the basis of the cross-validation coefficient of determination (R$^{\textrm{2}}$cv), the ratio of standard deviation of GC values to the standard error of cross-validation (RPD), and the validation coefficient of determination (R$^{\textrm{2}}$v). The third and fourth methods had, on average, the highest R$^{\textrm{2}}$cv, RPD, and R$^{\textrm{2}}$v. The final equations were built using all GC and the best accuracy was observed for the infrared predictions of C4:0, C6:0, C8:0, C10:0, C12:0, C14:0, C16:0, C18:0, C18:1 \textit{trans}, C18:1 \textit{cis}-9, C18:1 \textit{cis}, and for some groups of FA studied in milk (saturated, monounsaturated, unsaturated, short-chain, medium-chain, and long-chain FA). These equations showed R$^{\textrm{2}}$cv greater than 0.95. With R$^{\textrm{2}}$cv equal to 0.85, the MIR prediction of polyunsaturated FA could be used to screen the cow population. As previously published, infrared predictions of FA in fat are less accurate than those developed from FA content in milk (g/dL of milk) and no better results were obtained by using milk FA predictions if no corrections for bias and slope based on reference milk samples with known contents of FA were used. These results indicate the usefulness of equations with R$^{\textrm{2}}$cv greater than 95\% in milk payment systems and the usefulness of equations with R$^{\textrm{2}}$cv greater than 75\% for animal breeding purposes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Because of the known effects of fatty acids on human health, the development of a quick, inexpensive, and accurate method to directly quantify the fatty acid (FA) composition in milk would be valuable for milk processors to develop a payment system for milk pertinent to their customer requirements and for farmers to adapt their feeding systems and breeding strategies accordingly. The aim of this study was (1) to confirm the ability of mid-infrared spectrometry (MIR) to quantify individual FA content in milk by using an innovative procedure of sampling (i.e., samples were collected from cows belonging to different breeds, different countries, and in different production systems); (2) to compare 6 mathematical methods to develop robust calibration equations for predicting the contents of individual FA in milk; and (3) to test interest in using the FA equations developed in milk as basis to predict FA content in fat without corrections for the slope and the bias of the developed equations. In total, 517 samples selected based on their spectral variability in 3 countries (Belgium, Ireland, and United Kingdom) from various breeds, cows, and production systems were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). The samples presenting the largest spectral variability were used to calibrate the prediction of FA by MIR. The remaining samples were used to externally validate the 28 FA equations developed. The 6 methods were (1) partial least squares regression (PLS); (2) PLS+repeatability file (REP); (3) first derivative of spectral data+PLS; (4) first derivative+REP+PLS; (5) second derivative of spectral data+PLS; and (6) second derivative+REP+PLS. Methods were compared on the basis of the cross-validation coefficient of determination (R2cv), the ratio of standard deviation of GC values to the standard error of cross-validation (RPD), and the validation coefficient of determination (R2v). The third and fourth methods had, on average, the highest R2cv, RPD, and R2v. The final equations were built using all GC and the best accuracy was observed for the infrared predictions of C4:0, C6:0, C8:0, C10:0, C12:0, C14:0, C16:0, C18:0, C18:1 trans, C18:1 cis-9, C18:1 cis, and for some groups of FA studied in milk (saturated, monounsaturated, unsaturated, short-chain, medium-chain, and long-chain FA). These equations showed R2cv greater than 0.95. With R2cv equal to 0.85, the MIR prediction of polyunsaturated FA could be used to screen the cow population. As previously published, infrared predictions of FA in fat are less accurate than those developed from FA content in milk (g/dL of milk) and no better results were obtained by using milk FA predictions if no corrections for bias and slope based on reference milk samples with known contents of FA were used. These results indicate the usefulness of equations with R2cv greater than 95\% in milk payment systems and the usefulness of equations with R2cv greater than 75\% for animal breeding purposes.},

	abstract = {Milk fatty acid (FA) profile is a dynamic pattern influenced by lactational stage, energy balance and dietary composition. In the first part of this study, effects of the energy balance during the proceeding lactation [weeks 1–21 post partum (pp)] on milk FA profile of 30 dairy cows were evaluated under a constant feeding regimen. In the second part, effects of a negative energy balance (NEB) induced by feed restriction on milk FA profile were studied in 40 multiparous dairy cows (20 feed-restricted and 20 control). Feed restriction (energy balance of À 63 MJ NEL/d, restriction of 49 \% of energy requirements) lasted 3 weeks starting at around 100 days in milk. Milk FA profile changed markedly from week 1 pp up to week 12 pp and remained unchanged thereafter. The proportion of saturated FA (predominantly 10:0, 12:0, 14:0 and 16:0) increased from week 1 pp up to week 12 pp, whereas monounsaturated FA, predominantly the proportion of 18:1,9c decreased as NEB in early lactation became less severe. During the induced NEB, milk FA profile showed a similarly directed pattern as during the NEB in early lactation, although changes were less marked for most FA. Milk FA composition changed rapidly within one week after initiation of feed restriction and tended to adjust to the initial composition despite maintenance of a high NEB. C18:1,9c was increased significantly during the induced NEB indicating mobilization of a considerable amount of adipose tissue. Besides 18:1,9c, changes in saturated FA, monounsaturated FA, de-novo synthesized and preformed FA (sum of FA {\textgreater} C16) reflected energy status in dairy cows and indicated the NEB in early lactation as well as the induced NEB by feed restriction.},

	abstract = {Two experiments were conducted with lactating Angus × Gelbvieh beef cows to determine the effects of postpartum lipid supplementation, BCS at parturition, and day of lactation on fatty acid profiles in plasma, adipose tissue, and milk. In Exp. 1, 36 pri-miparous cows (488 ± 10 kg of initial BW; 5.5 ± 0.02 initial BCS) were given ad libitum access to hay and assigned randomly to a low-fat (control) supplement or supplements with cracked, high-linoleate safflower seeds (linoleate) or cracked, high-oleate safflower seeds (oleate) from d 3 to 90 of lactation. Diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous and isocaloric; safflower seed diets provided 5\% of DMI as fat. Plasma and milk samples were collected on d 30, 60, and 90 of lactation. Adipose tissue biopsies were collected near the tail-head region of cows on d 45 and 90 of lactation. In Exp. 2, 3-yr-old cows achieving a BCS of 4 ± 0.07 (479 ± 36 kg of BW) or 6 ± 0.07 (580 ± 53 kg of BW) at parturition were used in a 2-yr experiment (n = 36/yr). Beginning 3 d postpartum through d 61 of lactation, cows were fed diets similar to those of Exp. 1. Adipose tissue and milk samples were collected on d 30 and 60, and plasma was collected on d 31 and 61 of lactation. Responses to postpartum dietary treatment were comparable in both experiments. Cows fed linoleate and oleate had greater (P \&lt; 0.001) total fatty acid concentrations in plasma than cows fed control. Except for 15:1, milk fatty acids with \&lt;18 carbons were greatest (P ≤ 0.01) for cows fed control, whereas milk from cows fed linoleate had the greatest (P ≤ 0.02) 18:1trans-11, 18:2n-6, and cis-9, trans-11 CLA. Milk from cows fed oleate had the greatest (P \&lt; 0.001) 18:1cis-9. In Exp. 1, total fatty acid concentrations in adipose tissue samples decreased at d 90 compared with d 45 of lactation, but the fatty acid profile of cow adipose tissue was not affected (P = 0.14 to 0.80) by dietary treatment. In Exp. 2, the percentage of cis-9, trans-11 CLA in adipose tissue of cows with a BCS of 6 decreased (P = 0.001) from d 30 to 60 of lactation. Plasma and milk fatty acid composition reflected alterations in postpartum diet. Less medium-chain fatty acids and more 18-carbon fatty acids in milk were indicative of reduced de novo fatty acid synthesis in the mammary gland of beef cows fed lipid supplements; however, the metabolic demands of lactation prevented the deposition of exogenously derived fatty acids in adipose tissue through d 90 of lactation.},

	abstract = {Reproductive performance of dairy cattle has been related to a wide variety of indicators of energy status, e.g., extent of negative energy balance, time of energy balance nadir, body weight loss, body condition score, and body condition score loss. Energy balance begins to decrease during the last few weeks prior to calving primarily due to a 30–35\% reduction in feed intake. Cows typically remain in negative energy balance for five to seven weeks postpartum. Nutritional strategies to improve energy balance during the transition period include fat supplementation and feeding additional nonfiber carbohydrate. Unfortunately, neither approach is likely to markedly enhance energy status, although fat supplementation may increase reproductive efficiency independent of any effect on energy balance. Alternative management strategies may be required to improve fertility of dairy cows. Shortening or eliminating the dry period may improve energy status of dairy cows and increase reproductive efficiency. Shortening or eliminating the dry period may enhance dry matter intake during the transition period, decrease milk energy output, or both. A preliminary study using small animal numbers indicated that reducing dry period length to 28 or 0 days may decreases days to first ovulation, increase first service conception rate, and decrease days open. A follow-up study employing large animal numbers confirmed that reducing dry period length from 55 to 34 days can decrease days to first ovulation and decrease the percentage of anovular cows. The reduction in days open was greater for older cows than second parity cows. The reduction in days open was not related to effects of treatment on milk yield. Shortening or eliminating the dry period may be a more successful approach to improving reproductive efficiency than diet manipulation.},

	abstract = {Fertility in dairy cows has declined over the past five decades as milk production per cow has increased. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain this including issues of genetics, physiology, nutrition and management, and these factors have been investigated at the animal, organ and cellular level at critical time points of the productive life of dairy cows. This paper reviews the physiological events and their causes and consequences affecting fertility in dairy cows and summarises these in a downloadable poster. We consider the following points to have the greatest negative impact on fertility and that they need to be prioritised in efforts to ameliorate the problem (others have been included in the review). Firstly, minimise negative energy balance and resolve any infection of the post partum uterus. Secondly, expression and detection of oestrus followed by insemination with high quality semen (day 0). Thirdly, ovulation and fertilisation of a high quality oocyte (day 1). Fourthly, an early increase in progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum (days 3–7). Fifthly, the uterine endometrium must produce an early and appropriate environment to stimulate embryo development (days 6–13). This leads to sixthly, a large embryo producing adequate quantities of interferon tau (days 14–18) that alters uterine prostaglandin secretion and signals maternal recognition of pregnancy (days 16–18). Future strategies to improve dairy cow fertility are needed for the benefit of the dairy industry and for cow welfare and should be based upon an integrative approach of these events.},

	abstract = {Scoring body condition and assessing changes in the body condition of dairy cattle have become strategic tools in both farm management and research. Consequently, body condition score (BCS) is being researched extensively throughout the world. However, international sharing, comparing, and use of data generated are limited because different BCS systems exist. In the United States and Ireland a 5-point BCS system is used for dairy cows, whereas Australia and New Zealand use 8- and 10-point scales, respectively. The New Zealand 10-point scale was compared with the scoring systems in the United States, Ireland, and Australia by trained assessors. Cows were assessed visually in the United States and Australia, and in Ireland, cows were assessed by palpating key areas of the cow's body (n = 154, 110, and 120, respectively). Data were analyzed by regression. Significant positive linear relationships were found between the New Zealand 10-point scale and the other scoring systems: US 5-point scale, r2 = 0.54; Irish 5-point scale, r2 = 0.72; and Australian 8-point scale, r2 = 0.61. Those relationships must be interpreted cautiously because respective BCS within a given country were by just one experienced evaluator in each country in comparison to a separate evaluator scoring all cows in all counties using the New Zealand 10-point scale. Also, few very thin or very fat cows limit evaluation across extremes of BCS. However, differences between systems were not accurately predicted by simple mathematical calculations. The relationship may be closer for New Zealand and Ireland (r2 = 0.72) because both of those scoring systems include palpation of individual body parts, whereas visual evaluation is done in Australia and the United States. The current study is the first to examine relationships among differing BCS systems. These results may be useful for comparing/extrapolating research findings from different countries.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate, describe, and quantify daily body weight (BW) changes in the first 120 d of lactation in high-producing dairy cows. Data included 255,287 daily BW measurements from 2,167 Israeli Holstein dairy cows originating from 7 commercial dairy farms. Individual series of measurements were first smoothed using cubic splines for generating variables representing BW changes in early lactation and further analysis of the data. To construct standard BW curves stratified by parity and adjusted for farm, mixed models for repeated measurements were fit to the smoothed data, and least squares means for day in lactation were plotted. Time-series analysis techniques using polynomial functions of day in lactation and pairs of sine and cosine functions representing 7- and 21-d cycles were performed separately on each individual series of measurements. Additionally, generalized estimating equations were used to perform similar analysis on the data set as a whole. Mean days from calving to nadir BW increased significantly from first to later parities, as did mean BW loss from calving to nadir. The first-parity cow lost 6.5\% of her BW from calving to d 29 in lactation, and second-parity and greater-parity cows lost 8.5 and 8.4\% of their BW to d 34 and 38 in lactation, respectively. After nadir BW was reached, first-parity cows regained relative BW at a greater rate than did older parity cows. The trend in BW was nonlinear. A 7-d cycle was present in 247 cows (11.4\%) and a 21-d cycle was present in 715 cows (33.0\%). Presence of a 21-d cycle was associated with a 33\% reduction in the risk of being diagnosed with inactive ovaries. Fewer days from calving to nadir BW and smaller BW loss from calving to nadir, coupled with a faster post-nadir increase in relative BW in first-parity cows compared with older cows indicated a smaller energy deficit in early lactation. Association between 21-d cycles in BW and ovarian activity suggest that these cycles were physiological and related to the estrous cycle. Therefore, monitoring them could be useful for indirectly assessing ovarian activity in a herd.},

Milk yield was recorded daily and milk samples were collected during wk 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 postpartum for milk composition analysis. Milk samples from wk 1, 8, and 16 were also analyzed for fatty acid composition. Select-line cows produced more milk (44.4 vs. 31.2kg/d) and milk components than CL cows during the 16-wk period. There was no difference in rate of milk yield increase, but peak milk yield for SL cows was greater and occurred later in lactation. There were no differences in milk SCC or milk fat, protein, or lactose content. Selection for milk yield did not affect the content of most individual milk fatty acids; however, compared with CL, SL cows had a reduced ▵9-desaturase system and tended to produce milk with lower monounsaturated fatty acid content. Selection for milk yield did not affect milk fatty acid origin but the percentage of de novo fatty acids increased and preformed fatty acids decreased as lactation progressed. Milk fat trans-11 18:1 and cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid increased with progressing lactation (10.7 vs. 14.1 and 3.1 vs. 5.4mg/g, or 31 and 76\%, respectively) and were correlated strongly among wk 1, 8, and 16 of lactation. Temporal changes in the ▵9-desaturase system occurred during lactation but these changes were not correlated with milk fat cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid content. Results indicate prolonged genetic selection for milk yield had little effect on milk fatty acid composition, but milk fatty acid profiles varied markedly by week of lactation.},

	abstract = {The mammary gland has an incredible level of organization and a remarkable ability to convert circulating nutrients into milk components. This review highlights four areas of high interest in the biology of milk synthesis where advances over the last quarter-century have resulted in new understanding or revealed new opportunities. First, advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of milk secretion has led to a substantial increase in our knowledge of the intracellular origin of lipid droplets and the identity and potential function of milk fat globule membrane proteins in milk-lipid secretion. Second, recent breakthroughs have advanced our understanding of the nutritional regulation of milk fat and highlighted the interrelations between dietary components, digestive processes in the rumen, and the regulation of mammary synthesis of milk fat. Third, nutritional quality is becoming increasingly important in food choices because of consumer awareness of the links between diet and health. The traditional nutritional value of milk and dairy products is well established, but recent discoveries have identified a number of “bioactive” components in milk with potential to improve human health. Finally, the concept of genetic engineering and the use of animals as “bioreactors” and the “pharming” of proteins not normally found in milk have gained recognition, with the dairy industry ideally suited to take advantage of advances in these areas.},

	abstract = {The objective was to study the effects of body condition score (BCS) at calving on dairy performance, indicators of fat and protein mobilization, and metabolic and hormonal profiles during the periparturient period of Holstein-Friesian cows. Twenty-eight multiparous cows were classed according to their BCS (0 to 5 scale) before calving as low (BCS ≤2.5; n=9), medium (2.75≤BCS≤3.5; n=10), and high (BCS ≥3.75; n=9), corresponding to a mean of 2.33, 3.13, and 4.17 points of BCS, and preceding calving intervals of 362, 433, and 640d, respectively. Cows received the same diets based on preserved grass to allow ad libitum feed intake throughout the study, and lactation diet contained 30\% of concentrate (dry-matter basis). Measurements and sampling were performed between wk −4 and 7 relative to calving. No significant effects were observed of BCS group on dry matter intake (kg/d), milk yield, BCS loss, plasma glucose, and insulin concentrations. The high-BCS group had the lowest postpartum energy balance and the greatest plasma concentrations of leptin prepartum, nonesterified fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate postpartum, insulin-like growth factor 1, and milk fat content. Milk fat yield was greater for the high- than the low-BCS group (1,681 vs. 1,417g/d). Low-BCS cows had the greatest concentration of medium-chain fatty acids (e.g., sum of 10:0 to 15:0, and 16:0), and the lowest concentration and secretion of preformed fatty acids (e.g., cis-9 18:1) in milk fat. Milk protein secretion was lowest in the low-BCS group, averaging 924, 1,051, and 1,009g/d for low-, medium-, and high-BCS groups, respectively. Plasma 3-methylhistidine was greater in wk 1 and 2 postpartum compared with other time points, indicating mobilization of muscle protein. Plasma creatinine tended to be lower and the 3-methylhistidine: creatinine ratio was greater in low- compared with medium- and high-BCS cows, suggesting less muscle mass but more intense mobilization of muscle protein in lean cows. High-BCS cows were metabolically challenged during early lactation due to intense mobilization of body fat. Conversely, limited availability of body fat in low-BCS cows was associated with increased plasma indicators of body protein mobilization during the first weeks of lactation, and lower milk protein secretion. These results should be confirmed using an experimental approach where calving BCS variation would be controlled by design.},

With regard to dairy farming, the FA profile is also seen as an important factor in the technological quality of raw milk. In this sense, making targeted modifications to the FA profile has the potential to significantly contribute to the production of dairy products with higher added value. Thus, FAs also have economic importance. Current developments in analytical methods and their increasing efficiency enable the study of FA profiles not only for scientific purposes but also in terms of practical technological applications. It is important to study the sources of variability of FAs in milk, which include population genetics, type of farming, and targeted animal nutrition. It is equally important to study the health and technological impacts of FAs. This review summarizes current knowledge in the field regarding sources of FA variability, including the impact of factors such as: animal nutrition, seasonal feed changes, type of animal farming (conventional and organic), genetic parameters (influence of breed), animal individuality, lactation, and milk yield. Potential practical applications (to improve food technology and consumer health) of FA profile information are also reviewed.},

	abstract = {The inclusion of feed intake and efficiency traits in dairy cow breeding goals can lead to increased risk of metabolic stress. An easy and inexpensive way to monitor postpartum energy status (ES) of cows is therefore needed. Cows' ES can be estimated by calculating the energy balance from energy intake and output and predicted by indicator traits such as change in body weight (ΔBW), change in body condition score (ΔBCS), milk fat:protein ratio (FPR), or milk fatty acid (FA) composition. In this study, we used blood plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentration as a biomarker for ES. We determined associations between NEFA concentration and ES indicators and evaluated the usefulness of body and milk traits alone, or together, in predicting ES of the cow. Data were collected from 2 research herds during 2013 to 2016 and included 137 Nordic Red dairy cows, all of which had a first lactation and 59 of which also had a second lactation. The data included daily body weight, milk yield, and feed intake and monthly BCS. Plasma samples for NEFA were collected twice in lactation wk 2 and 3 and once in wk 20. Milk samples for analysis of fat, protein, lactose, and FA concentrations were taken on the blood sampling days. Plasma NEFA concentration was higher in lactation wk 2 and 3 than in wk 20 (0.56 ± 0.30, 0.43 ± 0.22, and 0.13 ± 0.06 mmol/L, respectively; all means ± standard deviation). Among individual indicators, C18:1 cis-9 and the sum of C18:1 in milk had the highest correlations (r = 0.73) with NEFA. Seven multiple linear regression models for NEFA prediction were developed using stepwise selection. Of the models that included milk traits (other than milk FA) as well as body traits, the best fit was achieved by a model with milk yield, FPR, ΔBW, ΔBCS, FPR × ΔBW, and days in milk. The model resulted in a cross-validation coefficient of determination (R2cv) of 0.51 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.196 mmol/L. When only milk FA concentrations were considered in the model, NEFA prediction was more accurate using measurements from evening milk than from morning milk (R2cv = 0.61 vs. 0.53). The best model with milk traits contained FPR, C10:0, C14:0, C18:1 cis-9, C18:1 cis-9 × C14:0, and days in milk (R2cv = 0.62; RMSE = 0.177 mmol/L). The most advanced model using both milk and body traits gave a slightly better fit than the model with only milk traits (R2cv = 0.63; RMSE = 0.176 mmol/L). Our findings indicate that ES of cows in early lactation can be monitored with moderately high accuracy by routine milk measurements.},

Milk FA can be routinely predicted by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and be, thus, used to develop an early indicator for bodyweight change (BWC) in early lactating cows in commercial dairy farms. Cow records from 165 herds in Denmark between 2015 and 2017 were used with bodyweight (BW) records at each milking from floor scales in automatic milking systems. Milk FA in monthly test-day samples was predicted by FTIR. Predictions of BWC were based on a random forest model and included parity, stage of lactation, and test day milk production and components (fat, protein, and FA). Bodyweight loss was mainly explained by decreased short-chain FA (C4:0\&ndash;C10:0) and increased C18:0 FA. The root mean square error (RMSE) of prediction after cross-validation was 1.79 g/kg of BW (R2 of 0.94). Model evaluation with previously unseen BWC records resulted in reduced prediction performance (RMSE of 2.33 g/kg of BW; R2 of 0.31). An early warning system may be implemented for cows with a large BW loss during early lactation based on milk FA profiles, but model performance should be improved, ideally by using the full FTIR milk spectra.},

The Afiweigh cow body weighing system records BW of every cow exiting the milking parlor. The Afiweigh system was installed at the Pennsylvania State University dairy herd in August 2001 and in July 2004 at the Virginia Tech dairy herd. The edited data included 202,143 daily BW and 290,930 daily MY observations from 575 Pennsylvania State University and 120 Virginia Tech Holstein cows. Data were initially analyzed with a series of 4-trait animal models, followed by random regression models. The models included fixed effects for age within lactation group, week of lactation, and herd-date. Random effects included animal, permanent environment, and error. The order of the polynomials for random animal and permanent environmental effects with the random regression model for daily BW was 4 and 6, respectively. Heritability estimates for daily BW ranged from 0.48 to 0.57 and were largest between 200 and 230 and smallest at 305 d of lactation. Genetic correlations were large between BW and BCS (0.60). The genetic correlation between daily BW and MY was −0.14 but was positive (0.24) after adjusting for BCS. Electronically recorded daily BW is highly heritable, and genetic evaluations of daily BW and BW change across the lactation could be used to select for less early lactation BW loss.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {With a growing human population facing multiple global change drivers (i.e. climate change and land management change), the future of food security is of major importance. Sustainable agriculture is therefore key to ensure food supply and food security under future climatic conditions. Forage provision (composed of forage quantity and forage quality) is an important ecosystem service of grasslands for dairy production. However, monitoring forage quality in semi-natural species-rich grasslands is rarely done due to the inherent complexity in determining forage quality, high variability within natural systems and financial and workload restrictions. Here, we i) demonstrate the ability of visible-near-infrared spectroscopy (vis-NIRS) to predict forage quality of bulk samples of species-rich montane pastures and ii) show its potential to reveal effects of two key global change drivers, climate change and land management, on forage quality. Spectral information and chemometrics allowed us to predict three (ash, fat and protein) out of four analyzed forage quality parameters with high accuracy. Land management intensity strongly influenced species-rich grasslands’ protein and fat content, whereas altered climatic conditions influenced ash and fat content. High management intensity increased protein content of high- and mid-elevation pastures by 22 \% and 30 \% and fat content by 19 \% and 20 \% respectively. Though forage quality was improved by intensive land management, extensive land management generally revealed sufficient forage quality for livestock. Vis-NIRS provides a rapid, cost-efficient and high-throughput technique to analyze forage quality, revealing effects of global change drivers on forage quality of grasslands. This approach will help to support stakeholders assure optimal nutrition feeding of livestock and achieve steps towards sustainable agriculture.},

Diets (563) from feeding trials published in the Journal of Dairy Science were evaluated for nutrient composition using 2 diet evaluation programs. Intake of nutrients was estimated based on DM intake and program-derived diet composition. Data were analyzed with and without the effect of stage of lactation. Models based on intake of nutrients improved prediction of milk yield and milk protein yield compared with DM intake alone. Intake of net energy of lactation was the dominant variable in milk yield prediction models derived from both diet evaluation models. Milk protein yield models also improved prediction over the DM intake model. These models were dominated by ruminally undegradable protein intake and included a number of energy-related intake variables. In most models, incorporating stage of lactation improved the model fit.},

The data analyzed included 81,313 BCS observations, 91,937 BW observations, and 100,458 milk test-day yields from 8725 multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows. A cubic random regression was sufficient to model the changing genetic variances for BCS, BW, and milk across different days in milk. The genetic correlations between BCS and fertility changed little over the lactation; genetic correlations between BCS and interval to first service and between BCS and pregnancy rate to first service varied from −0.47 to −0.31, and from 0.15 to 0.38, respectively. This suggests that maximum genetic gain in fertility from indirect selection on BCS should be based on measurements taken in midlactation when the genetic variance for BCS is largest. Selection for increased BW resulted in shorter intervals to first service, but more services and poorer pregnancy rates; genetic correlations between BW and pregnancy rate to first service varied from −0.52 to −0.45. Genetic selection for higher lactation milk yield alone through selection on increased milk yield in early lactation is likely to have a more deleterious effect on genetic merit for fertility than selection on higher milk yield in late lactation.},

	abstract = {Feed represents a large proportion of the variable costs in dairy production systems. The omission of feed intake measures explicitly from national dairy cow breeding objectives is predominantly due to a lack of information from which to make selection decisions. However, individual cow feed intake data are available in different countries, mostly from research or nucleus herds. None of these data sets are sufficiently large enough on their own to generate accurate genetic evaluations. In the current study, we collate data from 10 populations in 9 countries and estimate genetic parameters for dry matter intake (DMI). A total of 224,174 test-day records from 10,068 parity 1 to 5 records of 6,957 cows were available, as well as records from 1,784 growing heifers. Random regression models were fit to the lactating cow test-day records and predicted feed intake at 70d postcalving was extracted from these fitted profiles. The random regression model included a fixed polynomial regression for each lactation separately, as well as herd-year-season of calving and experimental treatment as fixed effects; random effects fit in the model included individual animal deviation from the fixed regression for each parity as well as mean herd-specific deviations from the fixed regression. Predicted DMI at 70d postcalving was used as the phenotype for the subsequent genetic analyses undertaken using an animal repeatability model. Heritability estimates of predicted cow feed intake 70d postcalving was 0.34 across the entire data set and varied, within population, from 0.08 to 0.52. Repeatability of feed intake across lactations was 0.66. Heritability of feed intake in the growing heifers was 0.20 to 0.34 in the 2 populations with heifer data. The genetic correlation between feed intake in lactating cows and growing heifers was 0.67. A combined pedigree and genomic relationship matrix was used to improve linkages between populations for the estimation of genetic correlations of DMI in lactating cows; genotype information was available on 5,429 of the animals. Populations were categorized as North America, grazing, other low input, and high input European Union. Albeit associated with large standard errors, genetic correlation estimates for DMI between populations varied from 0.14 to 0.84 but were stronger (0.76 to 0.84) between the populations representative of high-input production systems. Genetic correlations with the grazing populations were weak to moderate, varying from 0.14 to 0.57. Genetic evaluations for DMI can be undertaken using data collated from international populations; however, genotype-by-environment interactions with grazing production systems need to be considered.},

The analysis was performed using a single-trait RRM, including the additive genetic, permanent environmental, and residual effects. We estimated the mean trend of milk yield, and the additive genetic and permanent environmental covariance functions through random regression using different orders of orthogonal Legendre polynomial (three to six) and B-spline functions (linear, quadratic, and cubic, with three to six knots). This study further evaluated different number of classes of residual variances. The covariance components and the genetic parameters were estimated using the restricted maximum likelihood method. Heritability estimates presented similar trends for both functions. The RRM with a higher number of parameters better described the genetic variation of TDMY throughout the lactation. The most suitable RRM for genetic evaluation of TDMY of Alpine goats is a quadratic B-spline function with six knots, for the mean trend, curves of additive genetic and permanent environmental effects, and five classes of residual variance.},

	abstract = {Variance components of the covariance function coefficients in a random regression test-day model were estimated by Legendre polynomials up to a fifth order for first-parity records of Dutch dairy cows using Gibbs sampling. Two Legendre polynomials of equal order were used to model the random part of the lactation curve, one for the genetic component and one for permanent environment. Test-day records from cows registered between 1990 to 1996 and collected by regular milk recording were available. For the data set, 23,700 complete lactations were selected from 475 herds sired by 262 sires. Because the application of a random regression model is limited by computing capacity, we investigated the minimum order needed to fit the variance structure in the data sufficiently. Predictions of genetic and permanent environmental variance structures were compared with bivariate estimates on 30-d intervals. A third-order or higher polynomial modeled the shape of variance curves over DIM with sufficient accuracy for the genetic and permanent environment part. Also, the genetic correlation structure was fitted with sufficient accuracy by a third-order polynomial, but, for the permanent environmental component, a fourth order was needed. Because equal orders are suggested in the literature, a fourth-order Legendre polynomial is recommended in this study. However, a rank of three for the genetic covariance matrix and of four for permanent environment allows a simpler covariance function with a reduced number of parameters based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.},

assurer la rentabilité de leurs entreprises. Au vu de la structure du prix de revient
du lait, réduire les coûts alimentaires parait une piste intéressante pour améliorer les
performances économiques des élevages.
Accroitre l’efficience de l’utilisation de l’énergie des aliments par les animaux est
une des voies possibles. L’évaluation de l’efficience des animaux, quelle qu’en soit la
définition précise choisie, passe par la connaissance de leurs besoins de maintenance,
lesquels sont étroitement liés au poids corporel. Or l’acquisition de ces poids est très
difficile en pratique. L’ajustement d’équations prédictives du poids vif à partir de la
classification linéaire est une stratégie couramment employée dans la littérature pour
remédier à ce manque. De telles équations ont été développées en Wallonie par Laloux
(2008), et un des buts de ce travail est de les actualiser pour prendre en compte l’évolution
de la morphologie des animaux. La prise en compte du stade de lactation a été améliorée
en utilisant une méthode initialement développée pour la modélisation de courbes de
lactation. Les équations ainsi obtenues présentent des R2 de validation croisée de 0,53
et 0,46 pour les primipares et multipares respectivement.
Afin d’illustrer les possibilités d’utilisation de ces équations, des données issues de
la base de données alimentant l’évaluation génétique wallonne et du contrôle laitier ont
ensuite été utilisées pour construire un indicateur d’efficience utilisant des ingestions
prédites sur base des poids issus des nouvelles équations.
En conclusion, ces nouvelles équations devraient permettre d’améliorer les prédictions
actuelles, et elles ouvrent la porte à une future évaluation génétique du poids vif et de
l’efficience.},

Like this, a rapid measurement of lactose, galactose and lactic acid during lactic fermentation and sugars (glucose and fructose), glycerol and ethanol during alcoholic fermentation will constitute a major progress for the monitoring and the control of these processes. The samples, taken manually during the fermentations, permitted the determination of the interesting spectral ranges for the measurement of these compounds. These ranges, characterized by significant evolutions of absorbance, are situated in the middle infrared zone: between 1100 and 1040 cm−1 for lactose and galactose, between 1593 and 1515 cm−1 for lactate, between 1206 and 1026 cm−1 for molecules of the alcoholic fermentation and between 3000 and 1026 cm−1 for ethanol. Calibration is realized by the partial least-squares method from representative samples of the studied concentrations. The regression coefficients of the correlation between the concentrations measured by infrared spectrometry and liquid chromatography are better than 0.99. The maximum standard errors are 0.46, 0.57 and 0.95 g l−1, respectively for lactose, galactose and lactic acid; 2.5, 0.09 and 0.98 g l−1, respectively for the sugars, glycerol and ethanol.},

For Danish Holstein, 3,275 cows and 19,656 milk records were available. For Danish Jersey, 3,408 cows and 20,228 milk records were available. We used a hierarchical mixed model, with a Bayesian approach. Heritability of individual wavenumbers ranged from 0.00 to 0.31 in Danish Holstein, and from 0.00 to 0.30 in Danish Jersey. Genomic correlation was calculated between 15 selected wavenumbers, and varied from weak to very strong, in both Danish Holstein and Danish Jersey (0.03 to 0.97, and −0.11 to −0.97). Within the 15 selected wavenumbers, a subdivision into 2 groups of wavenumbers was observed, where genomic correlations were negative between groups, and positive within groups. Heritability and genomic correlations were higher in Danish Holstein compared with Danish Jersey, but followed a similar pattern in both breeds. Breed differences were most pronounced in the mid-infrared region that interacts with lactose and the spectral region that interacts with protein. In conclusion, heritability for individual wavenumbers of Fourier transform milk spectra was moderate, and strong genomic correlations were observed between wavenumbers across the spectrum. Heritability and genomic correlations were higher in Danish Holstein, with the strongest breed differences showing in spectral regions interacting with protein or lactose.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The suitability of mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) to follow the evolution throughout ripening of specific physicochemical parameters in Camembert-type cheeses was evaluated. The infrared spectra were obtained directly from raw cheese samples deposited on an attenuated total reflectance crystal. Significant correlations were observed between physicochemical data, pH, acid-soluble nitrogen, nonprotein nitrogen, ammonia (NH4+), lactose, and lactic acid. Dry matter showed significant correlation only with lactose and nonprotein nitrogen. Principal components analysis factorial maps of physicochemical data showed a ripening evolution in 2 steps, from d 1 to d 7 and from d 8 to d 27, similar to that observed previously from infrared spectral data. Partial least squares regressions made it possible to obtain good prediction models for dry matter, acid-soluble nitrogen, nonprotein nitrogen, lactose, lactic acid, and NH4+ values from spectral data of raw cheese. The values of 3 statistical parameters (coefficient of determination, root mean square error of cross validation, and ratio prediction deviation) are satisfactory. Less precise models were obtained for pH.},

The Emmental cheeses provided from different European countries were studied. A total of 91 cheeses produced during the winter time in Austria (n=4), Finland (n=6), Germany (n=13), France (n=30) and Switzerland (n=38) were analysed by near infrared (NIR) and mid infrared (MIR) spectroscopies. The combination of these two spectral regions (sum of their spectra) was also studied. The partial least square (PLS) regression with the leave one-out cross validation technique was used to build up calibration models using data set designated as calibration set. These models were validated with another data set designated as validation set. The obtained results suggest the use of the NIR for the determination of fat and TN contents, and the MIR for NaCl and NPN contents as well as for the pH. Similar results were obtained for WSN using the two techniques together. The combined spectra of both NIR and MIR did improve the results, while providing comparable results to those obtained from either the NIR or MIR spectroscopy.},

The dimensionality of traits was reduced by principal components analysis. Therefore, 46 principal components describing 99.03\% of the phenotypic variability were used to create 46 new traits. Variance components were estimated using canonical transformation. Heritability ranged from 0 to 0.35. Twenty-five out of 46 studied traits showed a permanent environment variance greater than genetic variance. Eight traits showed heritability greater than 0.10. Variances of original spectral traits were obtained by back transformation. Heritabilities for each spectral data points ranged from 0.003 to 0.42. In particular, 3 MIR regions showing moderate to high heritability estimates were of potential genetic interest. Heritabilities for specific wave numbers, linked with common milk traits (e.g., lipids, lactose), were similar to those estimated for these traits. This research confirms the genetic variability of the MIR milk spectrum and, therefore, the genetic variation of milk components. The objective of this study was to better understand the genetics of milk composition and, maybe in the future, to select animals to improve milk quality.},

	abstract = {In the context of cancer diagnosis and treatment, we consider the problem of constructing an accurate prediction rule on the basis of a relatively small number of tumor tissue samples of known type containing the expression data on very many (possibly thousands) genes. Recently, results have been presented in the literature suggesting that it is possible to construct a prediction rule from only a few genes such that it has a negligible prediction error rate. However, in these results the test error or the leave-one-out cross-validated error is calculated without allowance for the selection bias. There is no allowance because the rule is either tested on tissue samples that were used in the first instance to select the genes being used in the rule or because the cross-validation of the rule is not external to the selection process; that is, gene selection is not performed in training the rule at each stage of the cross-validation process. We describe how in practice the selection bias can be assessed and corrected for by either performing a cross-validation or applying the bootstrap external to the selection process. We recommend using 10-fold rather than leave-one-out cross-validation, and concerning the bootstrap, we suggest using the so-called .632+ bootstrap error estimate designed to handle overfitted prediction rules. Using two published data sets, we demonstrate that when correction is made for the selection bias, the cross-validated error is no longer zero for a subset of only a few genes.},

The purpose of this paper is to explore the nature of the VIP method and to compare with other methods through computer simulation experiments. We design 108 experiments where observations are generated from true models considering four factors–the proportion of the number of relevant predictors, the magnitude of correlations between predictors, the structure of regression coefficients, and the magnitude of signal to noise. Confusion matrix is adopted to evaluate the performance of PLS, the Lasso, and stepwise method. We also discuss the proper cutoff value of the VIP method to increase its performance. Some practical hints for the use of the VIP method are given as simulation results.},

The emphasis is on the rationale and broad scope of the NIPALS (Nonlinear Iterative PArtial Least Squares) approach to path models with latent variables. Characteristic of NIPALS modelling is the specification of causal and/or predictive relations in terms of predictors (conditional expectations), followed by least-squares estimation of the unknowns; namely, estimation by OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression of predictors where all variables are directly observed, and by iterative OLS when it comes to predictors that involve latent variables. At the gateway of the problem area is Hauser's pioneering model (1968, 1971). Various partings of the ways are examined on the basis of six NIPALS models, all of which are simple modifications of Hauser's model. The concluding remarks focus on the similarities and differences between NIPALS and ML (Maximum Likelihood) modelling.},

In correlated data, the change in the magnitude of 1 variable is associated with a change in the magnitude of another variable, either in the same (positive correlation) or in the opposite (negative correlation) direction. Most often, the term correlation is used in the context of a linear relationship between 2 continuous variables and expressed as Pearson product-moment correlation. The Pearson correlation coefficient is typically used for jointly normally distributed data (data that follow a bivariate normal distribution). For nonnormally distributed continuous data, for ordinal data, or for data with relevant outliers, a Spearman rank correlation can be used as a measure of a monotonic association. Both correlation coefficients are scaled such that they range from –1 to +1, where 0 indicates that there is no linear or monotonic association, and the relationship gets stronger and ultimately approaches a straight line (Pearson correlation) or a constantly increasing or decreasing curve (Spearman correlation) as the coefficient approaches an absolute value of 1. Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals can be used to address the statistical significance of the results and to estimate the strength of the relationship in the population from which the data were sampled.

We study the strengths and weaknesses of the wrapper approach and show a series of improved designs. We compare the wrapper approach to induction without feature subset selection and to Relief, a filter approach to feature subset selection.

	abstract = {Pregnancy diagnosis is an essential part of successful breeding programs on dairy farms. Milk composition alters with pregnancy, and this is well documented. Fourier-transform mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy is a rapid and cost-effective method for providing milk spectra that reflect the detailed composition of milk samples. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the ability of MIR spectroscopy to predict the pregnancy status of dairy cows. The MIR spectra and insemination records were available from 8,064 Holstein cows of 19 commercial dairy farms in Australia. Three strategies were studied to classify cows as open or pregnant using partial least squares discriminant analysis models with random cow-independent 10-fold cross-validation and external validation on a cow-independent test set. The first strategy considered 6,754 MIR spectra after insemination used as independent variables in the model. The results showed little ability to detect the pregnancy status as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.63 and 0.65 for cross-validation and testing, respectively. The second strategy, involving 1,664 records, aimed to reduce noise in the MIR spectra used as predictors by subtracting a spectrum before insemination (i.e., open spectrum) from the spectrum after insemination. The accuracy was comparable with the first approach, showing no superiority of the method. Given the limited results for these models when using combined data from all stages after insemination, the third strategy explored separate models at 7 stages after insemination comprising 348 to 1,566 records each (i.e., progressively greater gestation) with single MIR spectra after insemination as predictors. The models developed using data recorded after 150 d of pregnancy showed promising prediction accuracy with the average value of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78 and 0.76 obtained through cross-validation and testing, respectively. If this can be confirmed on a larger data set and extended to somewhat earlier stages after insemination, the model could be used as a complementary tool to detect fetal abortion.},

	abstract = {In identifying spectral outliers in near infrared calibration it is common to use a distance measure that is related to Mahalanobis distance. However, different software packages tend to use different variants, which lead to a translation problem if more than one package is used. Here the relationships between squared Mahalanobis distance D2, the GH distance of WinISI, and the T2 and leverage (L) statistics of The Unscrambler are established as D2 = T2 ≈ L × n ≈ GH × k, where n and k are the numbers of samples and variables, respectively, in the set of spectral data used to establish the distance measure. The implications for setting thresholds for outlier detection are discussed. On the way to this result the principal component scores from WinISI and The Unscrambler are compared. Both packages scale the scores for a component to have variances proportional to the contribution of that component to total variance, but the WinISI scores, unlike those from The Unscrambler, do not have mean zero.},

Quadratic regression equations of height and weight on age were computed for each herd. Estimated weight and height of heifers at 24 mo from these equations were found to be correlated with herd variables such as herd average milk production and age at first calving. Means and standard deviations for height and weight were determined for each age (1 through 24 mo). Third order regressions on age were fitted to the means to describe height and weight. Estimated height (cm) and weight (kg) at 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo were 101.0, 167.2; 117.6, 299.1; 127.4, 420.6; and 132.7, 516.2. A subset of data containing heifers in 89 herds that had a herd average milk production of {\textgreater}7264kg were also fitted to third order regression on age. Weight and height of dairy heifers are moderately larger in herds with {\textgreater}7264kg average milk production. Based on the entire data set, commercial Holstein herds in Pennsylvania have heifers somewhat larger than those used to develop National Research Council recommendations.},

This step is necessary to create common spectral databases, allowing the building of statistical tools, to be used by all instruments of the network. The method used was piecewise direct standardization (PDS), which matches slave-instrument spectra on master-instrument spectra. To evaluate the possibility of using common equations on different instruments, the PDS method was tested on a set of milk samples measured on each machine, and an equation predicting fat content of milk is applied on all. Regressions were performed between master and slaves fat predictions, before and after PDS. Bias and root mean square error between predictions were decreased after PDS, respectively, from 0.3781 to 0.0000 and from 0.4609 to 0.0156 (g of fat/100mL of milk). The stability over time of these results was confirmed by an application of the coefficients created by PDS 1 mo later on the slave spectra. These preliminary results showed that the PDS method permits a reduction of the inherent spectral variability between instruments, allowing the merging of Fourier transform mid-infrared milk spectra from different instruments into a common database, the creation of new types of dairy farm management indicators, and the use of these common calibrations for all Fourier transform mid-infrared instruments of the European dairy network.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Classical least squares (CLS) and partial least squares (PLS) are two common multivariate regression algorithms in chemometrics. This paper presents an asymptotically exact mathematical analysis of the mean squared error of prediction of CLS and PLS under the linear mixture model commonly assumed in spectroscopy. For CLS regression with a very large calibration set the root mean squared error is approximately equal to the noise per wavelength divided by the length of the net analyte signal vector. It is shown, however, that for a finite training set with n samples in p dimensions there are additional error terms that depend on σ2p2/n2, where σ is the noise level per co-ordinate. Therefore in the ‘large p—small n’ regime, common in spectroscopy, these terms can be quite large and even dominate the overall prediction error. It is demonstrated both theoretically and by simulations that dimensional reduction of the input data via their compact representation with a few features, selected for example by adaptive wavelet compression, can substantially decrease these effects and recover the asymptotic error. This analysis provides a theoretical justification for the need to perform feature selection (dimensional reduction) of the input data prior to application of multivariate regression algorithms.

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were to quantify the error of body weight prediction using automatically measured morphological traits in a 3-dimensional (3- D) vision system and to assess the influence of various sources of uncertainty on body weight prediction. In this case study, an image acquisition setup was created in a cow selection box equipped with a top-view 3-D camera. Morphological traits of hip height, hip width, and rump length were automatically extracted from the raw 3-D images taken of the rump area of dairy cows (n = 30). These traits combined with days in milk, age, and parity were used in multiple linear regression models to predict body weight. To find the best prediction model, an exhaustive feature selection algorithm was used to build intermediate models (n = 63). Each model was validated by leave-one-out cross-validation, giving the root mean square error and mean absolute percentage error. The model consisting of hip width (measurement variability of 0.006 m), days in milk, and parity was the best model, with the lowest errors of 41.2 kg of root mean square error and 5.2\% mean absolute percentage error. Our integrated system, including the image acquisition setup, image analysis, and the best prediction model, predicted the body weights with a performance similar to that achieved using semi-automated or manual methods. Moreover, the variability of our simplified morphological trait measurement showed a negligible contribution to the uncertainty of body weight prediction. We suggest that dairy cow body weight prediction can be improved by incorporating more predictive morphological traits and by improving the prediction model structure.},

Here the development of a camera system comprising multiple 3D cameras (six Microsoft Kinect cameras) for monitoring purposes in dairy cows is presented. A recording unit was constructed, and software for recording, synchronising, sorting and segmenting images, and transforming the 3D data in a joint coordinate system was implemented. The latter is called extrinsic calibration and was dealt with in this study using a 3D calibration object. The internal estimations of acceleration data and coefficients for the parametrised plane describing the floor of the scenery obtained by the Kinect camera were tested and discussed with regard to their usage in the calibration process. The presented approach accurately determined whether a Kinect device was a side view camera or one of two types of top view cameras (accuracy 92.9\%) and specified its mounting position in the system (accuracy 95.8\%). Furthermore, rotations and translations between the cameras and a reference coordinate system were estimated from 3D point clouds of the calibration object. For cameras in upright position (side view cameras) the rotational accuracies were satisfactory, showing 4.4° (±2.9°) deviation from the reference. For the cameras in top view position larger errors (25.5° ± 6.4°) were measured due to them being mounted in an inclined way. Nevertheless, a basis for registration methods was achieved.},

Then the digital photos of cows were taken from different directions synchronously and analyzed by IA software to calculate WH, HH, BL and HW of each cow. After comparing the BMs obtained by IA with the manual measurements, the accuracy was determined as 97.72\% for WH, 98.00\% for HH, 97.89\% for BL and 95.25\% for HW.

The experimental group of bulls was measured seven times every 60 days from housing at the average age of 139 days (181kg) till slaughtering (449 days, 594kg). Each bull was weighed, manually measured and captured by the thermal camera. This device, together with the image analysis algorithm, proved to be a successful tool for estimating the wither height (Wh) and hip height (Hh) during all seven age classes. The SEE values for Wh decreased significantly during all weighing from 5.49cm at day 139 to 1.11cm at day 449 and from 4.99 to 1.76cm for Hh, respectively. Two linear models for estimating current body weight at different ages were also developed on the basis of the long-term herd data of the Wh (BW1) and Hh (BW2) measurements. A statistically significant relationship (P{\textless}0.05) was found for all seven age classes, whereby the Radj2 was varying with the age from 0.11 to 0.66 (BW1) and from 0.15 to 0.74 (BW2). Since the SEE values increased a little from 24.96kg at day 139 to 33.59kg at last weighing for the BW1 and from 21.76 to 32.69kg for the BW2, both models expressed high accuracies. Therefore the thermal camera shows to be a useful tool in estimating live BW, which is of significant importance in reducing stress during progeny testing and beef production.},

	abstract = {Body weight (BW) of dairy cows can be estimated using linear conformation traits (calculated BW; CBW), which are generally recorded only once during a lactation. However, predicted BW (PBW) throughout the lactation would be useful, e.g., at milk-recording dates allowing feed-intake prediction for advisory purposes. Therefore, a 2-step approach was developed to obtain PBW for each milk-recording date. In the first step, a random-regression test-day model was used with CBW as observations to predict PBW. The second step consisted in changing means and (co)variances of prior distributions for the additive genetic random effects of the test-day model by using priors derived from results of the first step to predict again PBW. A total of 25,061 CBW from 24,919 primiparous Holstein cows were computed using equations from literature. Using CBW as observations, PBW was then predicted over the whole lactation for 232,436 dates corresponding to 207,375milk-recording dates and 25,061 classification dates. Results showed that using both steps (the 2-step approach) provided more accurate predictions than using only the first step (the one-step approach). Based on the results of this preliminary study, BW of dairy cows could be predicted throughout the lactation using this procedure. These predictions could be useful in milk-recording systems to compute traits of interest (e.g., feed-intake prediction). The developed novel method is also flexible because actual direct measurements of BW can also be used together with CBW, the prediction model being able to accommodate different levels of accuracies of used BW phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Liveweight (LWT) data for Australian Holstein cows was predicted from different type traits based on actual LWT and type data of 932 cows collected from 20 different herds over a 3-yr period. In addition to LWT measured using scales, visual estimates of LWT were also available on 90\% of the cows with LWT data. The future predictive ability of different models was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation. The relationships between LWT and selected type traits, including body condition score (BCS), were also calculated to assess the usefulness of various traits to predict LWT genetically. The relationships of predicted LWT measures with production and fitness traits were also estimated in an attempt to assess the consequence of continuous selection on an economic index that includes predicted LWT with a negative economic value. The heritability of LWT was 0.4. Among type traits, stature, chest width, bone quality, BCS, udder depth, central ligament, and muzzle width were correlated with LWT both genetically and phenotypically and were used to predict LWT of cows. Predicted LWT measures, using several sets of traits and visually estimated LWT were genetically highly correlated with each other ({\textgreater}0.73). Phenotypically, visually estimated LWT of cows was slightly more correlated with actual LWT than that predicted from type traits, but genetically both approaches gave the same accuracy. The predicted estimates of LWT were also positively genetically correlated with energy-corrected milk yield and had near zero correlation with survival. The correlations of different measures of LWT with fertility traits were unfavorable or near zero, suggesting that selection for reduced LWT may not cause deterioration in fertility traits. However, it may be useful to consider broadening the breeding objective to include traits that are associated with energy balance, particularly if traits such as BCS and bone quality are included in the set of traits used to predict LWT. Based on the results from this study, the inclusion of predicted LWT with negative economic values into the breeding objective would have no negative effect on fitness traits.},

Seven regression models were developed from data from 972 observations of 554 cows. Parity, hip height, hip width, and body condition score were consistently associated with BW. The coefficients of multiple determination varied from 80 to 89\%. The number of significant terms and the parameter estimates of the models differed markedly among groups of cows. Apparently, these differences were due to breed and feeding regimen. Results from this study indicate that a reliable model for estimating BW of very different dairy cows maintained in a wide range of environments can be developed using body condition score, demographic information, and measurements of hip height and hip width. However, for management purposes, substantial improvements can be obtained by developing models that are specific to a given site.},

Cows were raised at the Scottish Agricultural College research station and had calved between 2002 and 2010. Fifteen linear conformation traits were considered as predictors. To validate phenotypic predictions, the data set was randomly split into independent reference and validation subsets. Reference subsets were used to derive prediction equations with the use of a mixed model. Comparisons between predicted and actual liveweight in the validation subsets indicated that stature, chest width, body depth, and angularity could be used to derive phenotypic predictions of liveweight. Accuracy of these predictions was better for first-lactation than for all-lactation liveweight data. Significant genetic correlations between liveweight and the 4 predictor traits ranged from 0.49 to 0.76, and phenotypic correlations were 0.33 to 0.56. Estimated genetic (co)variances were used to develop prediction equations of animal genetic merit for liveweight from routinely calculated genetic evaluations for conformation traits.},

Regressions of body weight including the linear, quadratic, and cubic effects of a single independent variable (heart girth, wither height, hip width, or body length) indicated that each measurement would be useful in predicting body weight (R2{\textgreater}.95); the regression of body weight on heart girth had the highest R2, followed by hip width. Similarly, regressions of wither height on heart girth, wither height, hip width, or body length, including linear, quadratic, and cubic effects, yielded R2{\textgreater}.99. Regressions considering multiple traits as independent variables showed that the addition of a second body trait added little to the already high multiple correlations found with a single variable.

	abstract = {A regular and repeated recording of body weight (BW) is useful information for herd management. BW can be predicted regularly from animal characteristics such as age, lactation number, or lactation stage. Those traits are unfortunately animal unspeciﬁc. Adding animal speciﬁc information, which can be easily obtained on a large scale, to the BW prediction would be of utmost importance. There are good scientiﬁc reasons to suspect links between BW and animal speciﬁc characteristics, available in a repeated fashion, such as milk yield and milk composition. This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of predicting test-day BW from stage, lactation number, month of test, milk yield and mid-infrared spectra, representing milk composition. Five models were tested initially from 721 BW records collected in 6 herds: day in milk + number of lactation (equation 1a); equation1a + milk yield (equation 1b); only spectral data (equation 1c); equation 1c + equation 1a (equation 2); equation 2 + milk yield (equation 3). Then 3 other equations included the same explicative variables, except that the spectral data were regressed using second order Legendre Polynomials (PL) to take into account changes of spectral data within lactation. Equation 1a and 1b were built using linear regressions and equation 1c until 3 were built using partial least square regressions. These 3 last equations had a higher number of factors. Adding of MIR data in the equation increased of 7\% the values of cross-validation R² (R²cv). Potential BW outliers were discarded using a residual analysis based on equation 3. From 662 records, the following statistical parameters were obtained: the calibration coeﬃcient of determination (R²c) = 0.65, R²cv = 0.61, calibration root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP)=38 kg, and RMSEPcv=40 kg. Low variation of R²c and RMSEPc values obtained from the herd validation conﬁrmed the herd independence of predictions. However, large variability was observed for RMSEPv (37 to 64 kg) suggesting the need to increase the dataset in order to improve the robustness of the equation. By applying the equations on a large spectral database, it was conﬁrmed that the addition of MIR data allows to better model the BW evolution within lactation. Based on these preliminary results, and if a larger validation conﬁrms these ﬁndings, this approach could be used to develop equations that are better able to assess BW throughout lactation(s), BW being an important element for management and selection tools.},

	abstract = {Daily walkover liveweight (WoLW) records (n=79,697) from 463 pasture-fed dairy cows from a single dairy herd in the lower North Island of New Zealand were recorded over the first 100 d of lactation. The aims of this study were to (1) describe LW records retrieved by a standalone automatic Wo daily weighing system; (2) describe the frequency and nature of outlier LW records measured by the system and develop an approach for excluding identified outlier LW records; (3) quantify the agreement between cow LW measured using the Wo system and those measured statically; and (4) describe the autocorrelation between daily LW measurements to provide an indication of how frequently management decisions need to be reviewed to effectively monitor cow LW change in the early-lactation period. The standard deviation of daily LW measurements across parities was 17kg, on average. A near perfect association between LW measured statically and WoLW (concordance correlation coefficient 0.99, 95\% CI 0.99–1.0) was observed. After controlling for the effect of LW at calving and long-term LW change using a mixed-effects linear regression model, the autocorrelation between WoLW recorded on successive days was 0.21, decaying to zero by 8 d. This study shows that by using a standalone automatic Wo weighing system positioned in the exit race of a rotary milking parlor, it was possible to record LW of individual cows on a daily basis and, with controlled cow flow over the weighing platform (allowing for sufficient succession distance to prevent congestion), results were similar to those recorded using conventional, static weighing techniques using the same scales. Based on the autocorrelation analyses, we recommend that LW are recorded on a daily basis to allow changes in physiological status such as the onset of acute illness or estrus to be detected. For managerial purposes, such as using LW change as a guide for adjusting the herd feeding program, we recommend a 7-d decision interval to effectively monitor significant changes in cows’ recorded daily LW measurements.},

Data included automated daily BW measurements and BCS of 2,020 Israeli Holstein cows from 7 commercial farms. Individual BW series were smoothed using penalized cubic splines, and variables representing BW patterns were generated. The presence of 7- and 21-d cycles in BW was determined using time-series analysis. Associations between BW and BCS and conception at first artificial insemination (AI) were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Multivariate survival analysis was used for associations between BW and BCS and the calving-to-first AI interval, first AI-to-conception interval, and calving-to-conception interval. First-parity cows that lost ≥12\% and second-parity cows that lost ≥15\% of their BW from calving to nadir BW were less likely to conceive at first AI. Cows without 7-d cycles in BW were 1.48 times more likely to conceive at first AI relative to cows with 7-d cycles. The odds of conceiving at first AI increased by 53\% for each additional unit in BCS from 40 to 60 DIM. In the multivariate survival analysis, a BCS of ≤2.5 between 40 and 60 DIM, the percentage of BW lost from calving to nadir BW, and a BW loss of ≥7\% from calving to 10 DIM were associated with reduced reproductive performance. The presence of 21-d cycles in BW was associated with high reproductive performance in first-parity [odds ratio (OR) = 1.18] and second-parity cows (OR = 1.22). The presence of 7-d cycles in BW was associated with low reproductive performance in first-parity cows (OR = 0.77), but not in older cows. Based on previous findings and on the associations found in this study, we postulate that 21-d cycles are probably related to the sexual cycle and could be used as a proxy for assessing ovarian activity. Variables representing relative BW loss (\%) were better predictors for impaired reproductive performance than those representing absolute BW loss (kg) and may be more suitable for estimating individual adaptation to negative energy balance in herds for which automated daily BW is available.},

	abstract = {Ruminants contribute up to 80\% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from livestock, and enteric methane production by ruminants is the main source of these GHG emissions. Hence, reducing enteric methane production is essential in any GHG emissions reduction strategy in livestock. Data from 2 performance-recording research herds of Angus cattle were used to evaluate a number of methane measures that target methane production (MPR) independent of feed intake and to examine their phenotypic relationships with growth and body composition. The data comprised 777 young bulls and heifers that were fed a roughage diet (ME of 9 MJ/kg DM) at 1.2 times their maintenance energy requirements and measured for MP in open circuit respiration chambers for 48 h. Methane traits evaluated included DMI during the methane measurement period, MPR, and methane yield (MY; MPR/DMI), with means (±SD) of 6.2 ± 1.4 kg/d, 187 ± 38 L/d, and 30.4 ± 3.5 L/kg, respectively. Four forms of residual MPR (RMP), which is a measure of actual minus predicted MPR, were evaluated. For the first 3 forms, predicted MPR was calculated using published equations. For the fourth (RMP{\textasciicircum}sub R{\textasciicircum}), predicted MPR was obtained by regression of MPR on DMI. Growth traits evaluated were BW at birth, weaning (200 d of age), yearling age (400 d of age), and 600 d of age, with means (±SD) of 34 ± 4.6, 238 ± 37, 357 ± 45, and 471 ± 53 kg, respectively. Body composition traits included ultrasound measures (600 d of age) of rib fat, rump fat, and eye muscle area, with means (±SD) of 3.8 ± 2.6 mm, 5.4 ± 3.8 mm, and 61 ± 7.7 cm{\textasciicircum}sup 2{\textasciicircum}, respectively. Methane production was positively correlated (r ± SE) with DMI (0.65 ± 0.02), MY (0.72 ± 0.02), the RMP traits (r from 0.65 to 0.79), the growth traits (r from 0.19 to 0.57), and the body composition traits (r from 0.13 to 0.29). Methane yield was, however, not correlated (r ± SE) with DMI (-0.02 ± 0.04) as well as the growth (r from -0.03 to 0.11) and body composition (r from 0.01 to 0.06) traits. All the RMP traits were strongly correlated to MY (r from 0.82 to 0.95). These results indicate that reducing MPR per se can have a negative impact on growth and body composition of cattle. Reducing MY, however, will likely have the effect of reducing MPR without impacting productivity. Where a ratio trait is undesirable, as in animal breeding, any of the RMP traits can be used instead of MY. However, where independence from DMI is desired, RMP{\textasciicircum}sub R{\textasciicircum} should be a trait worth considering.},

The data consisted of 2,635 lactations from Holstein-Friesian (n=523) and Jersey (n=374) cows in a seasonal calving pasture-based research herd between the years 1986 and 2000, inclusive. Increased BCS at calving was associated with reduced SCS in first- and second-parity cows, and greater SCS in cows of third parity or greater. This relationship persisted for most BCS traits throughout lactation. Body weight was positively associated with SCS, although the effect was greater in Jersey cows than in Holstein-Friesians. Increased BCS and BW loss in early lactation were associated with lower SCS and a reduced probability of a high test-day SCC. Body condition score was not significantly related to CM with the exception of a curvilinear relationship between the daily rate of BCS change to nadir and CM in early lactation. Several BW variables were positively associated with a greater likelihood of CM. Nevertheless, most associations with udder health lacked biological significance within the ranges of BCS and BW generally observed on-farm. Results are important in assuring the public that modern dairy systems, where cows are subjected to substantial amounts of BCS mobilization in early lactation, do not unduly compromise cow udder health.},

	abstract = {Precise energy balance estimates for individual cows are of great importance to monitor health, reproduction, and feed management. Energy balance is usually calculated as energy input minus output (EBinout), requiring measurements of feed intake and energy output sources (milk, maintenance, activity, growth, and pregnancy). Except for milk yield, direct measurements of the other sources are difficult to obtain in practice, and estimates contain considerable error sources, limiting on-farm use. Alternatively, energy balance can be estimated from body reserve changes (EBbody) using body weight (BW) and body condition score (BCS). Automated weighing systems exist and new technology performing semi-automated body condition scoring has emerged, so frequent automated BW and BCS measurements are feasible. We present a method to derive individual EBbody estimates from frequently measured BW and BCS and evaluate the performance of the estimated EBbody against the traditional EBinout method. From 76 Danish Holstein and Jersey cows, parity 1 or 2+, on a glycerol-rich or a whole grain-rich total mixed ration, BW was measured automatically at each milking. The BW was corrected for the weight of milk produced and for gutfill. Changes in BW and BCS were used to calculate changes in body protein, body lipid, and EBbody during the first 150d in milk. The EBbody was compared with the traditional EBinout by isolating the term within EBinout associated with most uncertainty; that is, feed energy content (FEC); FEC=(EBbody+EMilk+EMaintenance+Eactivity)/dry matter intake, where the energy requirements are for milk produced (EMilk), maintenance (EMaintenance), and activity (EActivity). Estimated FEC agreed well with FEC values derived from tables (the mean estimate was 0.21MJ of effective energy/kg of dry matter or 2.2\% higher than the mean table value). Further, the FEC profile did not suggest systematic bias in EBbody with stage of lactation. The EBbody estimated from daily BW, adjusted for milk and meal-related gutfill and combined with frequent BCS, can provide a successful tool. This offers a pragmatic solution to on-farm calculation of energy balance with the perspective of improved precision under commercial conditions.},

This study establishes the repeatability of an automated walk-over cattle-weighing system, and agreement with static electronic scales, when used in a commercial dairy herd to weigh lactating cows. Forty-six lactating dairy cows from a seasonal calving, pasture-based dairy herd in southwest Victoria, Australia, were weighed once using a set of static scales and repeatedly using an automated walk-over weighing system at the exit of a rotary dairy.

The purpose of this research is to determine the body length, chest circumference, hump height, and hip height for prediction of the mass of cow’s body with image processing. Prediction of the body dimensions with image processing was done by drawing a line on the image correspond with the point of body dimensions measurement and then calculating the number of pixels of each variable of the body size with the Euclidean equation. The mass of cow’s body is predicted by using multiple linear regression equations with two models of regression equation i.e. 1) regression equation with two variables (body length and chest circumference) and 2) regression equation with four variables (body length, chest circumference, hump height, and hip height). Dimensions of cow’s body obtained from image processing were usually smaller than those obtained from manual measurement. As compared to manual measurements, the average error of body length was 8.8\%, the average error of chest circumference was 4.0\%, the average error of hump height was 11.8\%, and the average error of hip height was 8.3\%. Based on regression models, hump height and hip height did not much affect the cow’s body weight, so the regression models only use with two variables: body length (BL) and chest circumference (CC). The model gave an average error 6.4\% or about 17.5 kg out of the average weight 234 kg.},

					This study was realized to evaluate prediction models for body weight (BW) using body measurements as heart girth (HG), wither height (WH), hip width (HW), body length (BL) and hip height (HH), and develop new Equations to predict the BW of Holstein and crossbred heifers. Prediction Equations (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) proposed in previous studies were tested, while body measurements, which were more significant in terms of predicting BW, were used to obtain new Equations. Heart girth was the body measurement with the greater correlation with BW. Equation 4 presented the best prediction results, showing a low average deviation, high accuracy and precision. Equations 1 and 2 predicted with a high presence of bias, while 2 had the lowest value of the concordance correlation coefficient and a great contribution made by systematic error. The 3 model presented a high variability in predicting BW. For both Holstein and crossbred heifers, the Equations evaluated are inadequate for predicting BW. Among the Equations evaluated, the model using HG presented the best adjustment and the greater adjusted coefficient of determination. Body measurements relating to HG and BL were the most significant variables in predicting the BW, resulting in the following Equation: BW = - 372.89 + 2.8072 × HG + 1.6087 × BL.},

	abstract = {Body composition and live animal measurements of Holstein–Friesian lactating dairy cows (n=146) were obtained from a large herd to represent a range of animal factors including parity, live weight (LW), body condition score (BCS), milk yield and stage of lactation. Live animal measurements were recorded 3 or 4 days prior to slaughter, including LW, BCS, milk yield, heart girth, belly girth, withers height and length. The objective was to develop prediction equations for body weight and component mass from body size measurements and other live animal data. All body size measurements were positively (P{\textless}0.001) related to LW, empty body (EB) weight (EBW), carcass weight and EB masses (kg) of lipid, CP, DM, water and ash and total GE content (MJ). The correlation coefficients (r) in these relationships were highest with heart girth (0.62 to 0.88), followed by belly girth (0.52 to 0.88) and length (0.51 to 0.83) and lowest with withers height (0.35 to 0.69). Heart girth was therefore selected as the primary predictor and a number of equations were then developed for prediction of body weight and EB mass, with the effect of parity or stage of lactation removed, where appropriate. All relationships were significant (P{\textless}0.001) and each predictor had a significant effect on the relationship (P{\textless}0.05). The adjusted R2 values in the linear/quadratic relationships of heart girth with body weight and EB masses ranged from 0.53 (lipid mass) to 0.78 (LW). Addition of a range of other live animal variables (belly girth, length and BCS) to support heart girth significantly improved all relationships, with the Cp statistic and RMSPE (root mean square prediction error) values considerably reduced and adjusted R2 values increased. These equations were evaluated through internal validation, by developing a range of similar new equations from two thirds of the present data and then validating these new equations with the remaining one third of data. The validation revealed a high prediction accuracy for LW, EBW, carcass weight and EB masses of CP, water and DM, a relatively good accuracy for EB lipid mass and total GE content, and a relatively poor accuracy for EB ash mass. In conclusion, body size measurements can be used together with other live animal factors to accurately predict body weight and EB component mass of lactating dairy cows. These equations provide an alternative approach to estimate body weight and component mass of lactating dairy cows.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The objective of this study was to predict cows' body weight from body size measurements and other animal data in the lactation and dry periods. During the whole year 2014, 6306 cows (on 167 commercial Austrian dairy farms) were weighed at each routine performance recording and body size measurements like heart girth (HG), belly girth (BG), and body condition score (BCS) were recorded. Data on linear traits like hip width (HW), stature, and body depth were collected three times a year. Cows belonged to the genotypes Fleckvieh (and Red Holstein crosses), Holstein, and Brown Swiss. Body measurements were tested as single predictors and in multiple regressions according to their prediction accuracy and their correlations with body weight. For validation, data sets were split randomly into independent subsets for estimation and validation. Within the prediction models with a single body measurement, heart girth influenced relationship with body weight most, with a lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 39.0\&thinsp;kg, followed by belly girth (39.3\&thinsp;kg) and hip width (49.9\&thinsp;kg). All other body measurements and BCS resulted in a RMSE of higher than 50.0 kg. The model with heart and belly girth (Model{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{HG BG}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) reduced RMSE to 32.5\&thinsp;kg, and adding HW reduced it further to 30.4\&thinsp;kg (Model{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{HG BG HW}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}). As RMSE and the coefficient of determination improved, genotype-specific regression coefficients for body measurements were introduced in addition to the pooled ones. The most accurate equations, Model{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{HG BG}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} and Model{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{HG BG HW}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, were validated separately for the lactation and dry periods. Root mean square prediction error (RMSPE) ranged between 36.5 and 37.0\&thinsp;kg (Model{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{HG BG HW}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, Model{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{HG BG}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, lactation) and 39.9 and 41.3\&thinsp;kg (Model{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{HG BG HW}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, Model{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{HG BG}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, dry period). Accuracy of the predictions was evaluated by decomposing the mean square prediction error (MSPE) into error due to central tendency, error due to regression, and error due to disturbance. On average, 99.6\&thinsp;\% of the variance between estimated and observed values was caused by disturbance, meaning that predictions were valid and without systematic estimation error. On the one hand, this indicates that the chosen traits sufficiently depicted factors influencing body weight. On the other hand, the data set was very heterogeneous and large. To ensure high prediction accuracy, it was necessary to include body girth traits for body weight estimation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The aim of the present study was to assess the relationships of lactose percentage (LP), lactose yield (LY), and freezing point (FRP) with minerals and coagulation properties predicted from mid-infrared spectra in bovine milk. To achieve this purpose, we analyzed 54,263 test-day records of 4,297 Holstein cows to compute (co)variance components with a linear repeatability animal model. Parity, stage of lactation, season of calving, and herd-test-date were included as fixed effects in the model, and additive genetic animal, within- and across-lactation permanent environment, and residual were included as random effects. Lactose percentage was more heritable (0.405 ± 0.027) than LY (0.121 ± 0.021) and FRP (0.132 ± 0.014). Heritabilities (± standard error) of predicted milk minerals varied from 0.375 ± 0.027 for Na to 0.531 ± 0.028 for P, and those of milk coagulation properties ranged from 0.348 ± 0.052 for rennet coagulation time to 0.430 ± 0.026 for curd firming time. Lactose percentage showed favorable (negative) genetic correlations with milk somatic cell score (SCS) and FRP, and it was almost uncorrelated with casein-related minerals (Ca and P) and coagulation properties. Moreover, LP was strongly correlated with Na (−0.783 ± 0.022), a mineral known to increase in the presence of intramammary infection (IMI) and high somatic cell count. Indeed, Na is the main osmotic replacer of lactose in mastitic milk when the blood–milk barrier is altered during IMI. Being strongly associated with milk yield, LY did not favorably correlate with coagulation properties, likely because of the negative correlation of this trait with protein and casein percentages. Milk FRP presented moderate and null genetic associations with Na and SCS, respectively. Results of the present study suggest that the moderate heritability of LP and its genetic correlations with IMI-related traits (Na and SCS) could be exploited for genetic selection against mastitis. Moreover, selection for LP would not impair milk coagulation characteristics or Ca and P content, which are important for cheesemaking.},

	abstract = {The methods available for measuring organic P and bound Ca in cheese are either cumbersome or involve dilution of the cheese. Dilution of the cheese can lead to erroneous results, particularly in the case of bound Ca. Hence, the objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for direct measurement of organic P and bound Ca in Cheddar cheese. Two hundred sixteen samples of cheese were analyzed for protein-bound organic P, bound Ca using a water-extraction based method, and buffering curves. Additionally, the infrared spectra of the cheeses were collected between 4,000 and 650cm−1, at a resolution of 4cm−1, and 256 scans per sample. The spectral shifts in the infrared region from 1,050 to 900cm−1, in addition to the measured concentrations of organic P, bound Ca, and buffering peak area at pH 5.1, were used to develop calibration models using partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis. The spectral region of 956 to 946cm−1 correlated with the measured concentrations of organic P and the overall PLS model had a correlation (R2) of 0.76 between the predicted and measured concentrations. The spectral region at ∼980cm−1 was correlated with the measured concentrations of bound Ca, and the overall PLS model had a correlation (R2) of 0.70 between the predicted and measured concentrations. A similar spectral region at ∼980cm−1 was also correlated with the measured buffering peak areas and the overall PLS model had a correlation (R2) of 0.64 between the predicted and measured peak areas. A linear regression analysis between the bound Ca and buffering peak area demonstrated that bound Ca was correlated (R2=0.73) with buffering peak area. This study demonstrates that FTIR can be used to measure organic P in cheeses. It also has the potential to be used for measuring bound Ca in undiluted cheeses, and for prediction of the buffering capacity of cheese.},

	abstract = {Food adulteration is a profit-making business for some unscrupulous manufacturers. Maple syrup is a soft target of adulterators owing to its simplicity of chemical composition. In this study the use of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to detect adulterants such as cane and beet invert syrups as well as cane and beet sugar solutions in maple syrup was investigated. The FTIR spectrum of adulterated samples was characterised and the regions 800–1200 cm−1 (carbohydrates) and 1200–1800 and 2800–3200 cm−1 (carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and amino acids) were used for detection. The region between 1100 and 1660 nm in the NIR spectrum was used for analysis. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and canonical variate analysis (CVA) were used for discriminant analysis, while partial least squares (PLS) and principal component regression (PCR) were used for quantitative analysis. FTIR was more accurate in predicting adulteration using two different regions (R2 {\textgreater} 0.93 and {\textgreater}0.98) compared with NIR (R2 {\textgreater} 0.93). Classification and quantification of adulterants in maple syrup show that NIR and FTIR can be used for detecting adulterants such as pure beet and cane sugar solutions, but FTIR was superior to NIR in detecting invert syrups. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry},

	abstract = {Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was used to study the nature of the linkage and interactions of phosphate ester bonds in αs-casein under precipitation by chitosan. We have found that the dianionic stretching band of the covalently bound phosphate in αs-casein at 976cm−1 is sensitive to the ionization state and the binding of Ca2+ or chitosan. Thus, the neutralization of the negative charges of carboxylates and phosphates by lowering the pH of αs-casein solution from 6.8 to 2.0 led to a dramatic reduction of this signal. Precipitating amounts of Ca2+ caused a shift in the phosphate signal from 976 to 986cm−1 indicating a direct electrostatic interaction between Ca2+ and phosphate. The interaction of αs-casein with low molecular weight chitosan showed a small shift (ca. 2cm−1) in the phosphate peak position as compared with pure αs-casein with a pronounced reduction in the phosphate peak amplitude that was about a half of that of casein alone. When αs-casein was precipitated with high molecular weight chitosan, a more noticeable effect occurred as this complex showed only around 25\% of the phosphate peak amplitude. The interactions between the phosphate groups covalently bound to αs-casein and the amino groups in chitosan seem to induce changes similar to those observed upon protonation of the negative charges of phosphate.},

	abstract = {Mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) is traditionally used for analysing milk fat, protein and lactose concentrations in dairy production, but there is growing interest in using it to predict difficult, or expensive-to-measure, phenotypes on a large scale. The resulting prediction equations can be applied to MIRS data from commercial herd-testing, to facilitate management and feeding decisions, or for genomic selection purposes. We investigated the ability of MIRS of milk samples to predict milk fatty acids (FAs) and energy balance (EB) of dairy cows in Australia. Data from 240 Holstein lactating cows that were part of two 32-day experiments, were used. Milk FAs were measured twice during the experimental period. Prediction models were developed using partial least-square regression with a 10-fold cross-validation. Measures of prediction accuracy included the coefficient of determination (R2cv) and root mean-square error. Milk FAs with a chain length of ≤16 were accurately predicted (0.89 ≤ R2cv ≤ 0.95), while prediction accuracy for FAs with a chain length of ≥17 was slightly lower (0.72 ≤ R2cv ≤ 0.82). The accuracy of the model prediction was moderate for EB, with the value of R2cv of 0.48. In conclusion, the ability of MIRS to predict milk FAs was high, while EB was moderately predicted. A larger dataset is needed to improve the accuracy and the robustness of the prediction models.},

	abstract = {Milk and dairy products are a major source of minerals, particularly calcium, involved in several metabolic functions in humans. Currently, several dairy products are enriched with calcium to prevent osteoporosis. The development of an inexpensive and fast quantitative analysis for minerals is required to offer dairy farmers an opportunity to improve the added value of the produced milk. The aim of this study was to develop 5 equations to measure Ca, K, Mg, Na, and P contents directly in bovine milk using mid-infrared (MIR) spectrometry. A total of 1,543 milk samples were collected between March 2005 and May 2006 from 478 cows during the Walloon milk recording and analyzed by MIR spectrometry. Using a principal component approach, 62 milk samples were selected by their spectral variability and separated in 2 calibration sets. Five outliers were detected and deleted. The mineral contents of the selected samples were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. Using partial least squares combined with a repeatability file, 5 calibration equations were built to estimate the contents of Ca, K, Mg, Na, and P in milk. To assess the accuracy of the developed equations, a full cross-validation and an external validation were performed. The cross-validation coefficients of determination (R2cv) were 0.80, 0.70, and 0.79 for Ca, Na, and P, respectively (n=57), and 0.23 and 0.50 for K and Mg, respectively (n=31). Only Ca, Na, and P equations showed sufficient R2cv for a potential application. These equations were validated using 30 new milk samples. The validation coefficients of determination were 0.97, 0.14, and 0.88 for Ca, Na, and P, respectively, suggesting the potential to use the Ca and P calibration equations. The last 30 samples were added to the initial milk samples and the calibration equations were rebuilt. The R2cv for Ca, K, Mg, Na, and P were 0.87, 0.36, 0.65, 0.65, and 0.85, respectively, confirming the potential utilization of the Ca and P equations. Even if new samples should be added in the calibration set, the first results of this study showed the feasibility to quantify the calcium and phosphorus directly in bovine milk using MIR spectrometry.},

	abstract = {The composition of cow milk is strongly affected by the feeding regimen. Because milk components are routinely determined using mid-infrared (MIR) spectrometry, MIR spectra could also be used to estimate an animal's ration composition. The objective of this study was to determine whether and how well amounts of dry matter intake and the proportions of concentrates, hay, grass silage, maize silage, and pasture in the total ration can be estimated using MIR spectra at an individual animal level. A total of 10,200 milk samples and sets of feed intake data were collected from 90 dairy cows at 2 experimental farms of the Agricultural Research and Education Centre in Raumberg-Gumpenstein, Austria. For each run of analysis, the data set was split into a calibration and a validation data set in a 40:60 ratio. Estimated ration compositions were calculated using a partial least squares regression and then compared with the respective observed ration compositions. In separate analyses, the factors milk yield and concentrate intake were included as additional predictors. To evaluate accuracy, the coefficient of determination (R2) and ratio to performance deviation were used. The highest R2 values (for kg of dry matter intake/for \% of ration) for the individual feedstuffs were as follows: pasture, 0.63/0.66; grass silage, 0.32/0.43; concentrate intake, 0.39/0.34; maize silage, 0.32/0.33; and hay, 0.15/0.16. Estimation of groups of feedstuffs (forages, energy-dense feedstuffs) mostly resulted in R2 values {\textgreater}0.50. Including the parameters milk yield or concentrate intake improved R2 values by up to 0.21, with an average improvement of 0.04. The results of this study indicate that not all ration components may be estimated equally accurately. Even if some estimates are good on average, there may be strong deviations between estimated and observed values in individual data sets, and therefore individual estimates should not be overemphasized. Further research including pooled samples (e.g., bulk milk, farm samples) or variations in ration composition is called for.},

	abstract = {The objective of the present study was to identify and quantify relationships among dairy cow body condition score (BCS) and body weight (BW) and production variables in pasture-based, seasonal-calving herds. More than 2,500 lactation records from 897 spring-calving Holstein-Friesian and Jersey dairy cows were used in the analyses. Six variables related to BCS and BW, including observations precalving, at calving, and nadir as well as days to nadir and change precalving and between calving and nadir were generated. An exponential function was fitted within lactation to milk and 4\% fat-corrected milk (FCM) yield data to model lactation curves. The milk production variables investigated were the parameters of the fitted function as well as accumulated yield of milk and FCM at 60 and 270 days in milk and average milk composition. Mixed models were used to identify BCS and BW variables that significantly affected milk production. After adjusting for the fixed effect of year of calving, parity, and days dry, milk and FCM yields were nonlinearly associated with calving and nadir BCS, increasing at a declining rate up to BCS 6.0 to 6.5 (10-point scale; approximately 3.5 in the 5-point scale) and declining thereafter. However, there was very little increase in milk and FCM yields above a calving BCS of 5.0 (approximately 3.0 in the 5-point scale). Average milk fat content over 60 and 270 days in milk was positively correlated with increasing calving and nadir BCS. In comparison, milk protein percentage was not influenced by calving BCS but was positively associated with nadir BCS and negatively associated with BCS lost between calving and nadir. The effect of BW and changes in BW were similar to the effect of BCS, although the scale of the effect was breed-dependent. For example, milk and FCM yield increased linearly with increasing calving BCS, but the effect was greater in Holstein-Friesians compared with Jersey cows. The results are consistent with the literature and highlight the important role that BCS and BW loss has on milk production, irrespective of the system of farming.},

	abstract = {Interactions between genotype and environment are becoming increasingly important as cattle genotypes are being managed in a diverse range of environments worldwide. The objective of this study was to investigate if there is an interaction of strain of Holstein-Friesian cows (HF) by grass-based feed system that affects milk production, body weight, and body condition score. Three strains of HF were compared on 3 pasture-based feed systems over 3 consecutive years. The 3 strains of HF were: high production North American, high durability North American, and New Zealand. The 3 grass-based feeding systems (FS) were: a high grass allowance system (MPFS), a high concentrate system (HCFS), and a high stocking rate system (HSFS). There was a separate farmlet for each FS and a total of 99, 117, and 117 animals were used in yr 1, 2, and 3 respectively, divided equally between strains of HF and FS. The high production cows produced the highest yield of milk, the New Zealand the lowest, and the high durability animals were intermediate. Milk fat and protein content were higher for the New Zealand strain than for the high production and high durability strains. The New Zealand strain had the lowest body weight and the highest condition score, whereas the high durability strain had the highest body weight, and the high production strain had the lowest condition score. There was a strain×FS interaction for yield of milk, fat, and protein. The milk production response to increased concentrate supplementation (MPFS vs. HCFS) was greater with both the high production and high durability strains (1.10kg of milk/kg of concentrate for high production; 1.00kg of milk/kg of concentrate for high durability) than the New Zealand strain (0.55kg of milk/kg of concentrate). The results indicate that the optimum strain of HF will vary with feed system.},

	abstract = {The milk production, energy balance (EB), endocrine and metabolite profiles of 10 New Zealand Holstein Friesian (NZ) cows and 10 North American Holstein Friesian (NA) cows were compared. The NA cows had greater peak milk yields and total lactation milk yields (7387 v. 6208 kg; s.e.d. = 359), lower milk fat and similar protein concentrations compared with the NZ cows. Body weight (BW) was greater for NA cows compared with NZ cows throughout lactation (596 v. 544 kg; s.e.d. = 15.5), while body condition score (BCS) tended to be lower. The NA strain tended to have greater dry matter intake (DMI) (17.2 v. 15.7 kg/day; s.e.d. = 0.78) for week 1 to 20 of lactation, though DMI as a proportion of metabolic BW was similar for both strains. No differences were observed between the strains in the timing and magnitude of the EB nadir, interval to neutral EB, or mean daily EB for week 1 to 20 of lactation. Plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin were greater for NA cows during the transition period (day 14 pre partum to day 28 post partum). Plasma IGF-I concentrations were similar for the strains at this time, but NZ cows had greater plasma IGF-I concentration from day 29 to day 100 of lactation, despite similar calculated EB. In conclusion, the results of this study do not support the premise that the NZ strain has a more favourable metabolic status during the transition period. The results, however, indicate that NZ cows begin to partition nutrients towards body reserves during mid-lactation, whereas NA cows continue to partition nutrients to milk production.},

When a set of sequences or processes is characterized by multivariate data, a three-way data matrix is obtained. With sequences the position and with processes the time is one direction in this matrix. The multivariate modelling of this matrix by principal component analysis (PCA) or partial least-squares (PLS) methods for the following purposes is discussed: classification of sequences; quantitative relationships between sequence and biological activity or chemical properties; optimizing a sequence with respect to selected properties; process diagnostics; and quantitative relationships between process variables and product quality variables. To obtain good models, a number of problems have to be adequately dealt with: appropriate characterization of the sequence or process; experimental design (selecting sequences or process settings); transforming the three-way into a two-way matrix; and appropriate modelling and validation (modelling interactions, periodicities, “time series” structures and “neighbour effects”). A multivariate approach to sequence and process modelling using PCA and PLS projections to latent structures is discussed and illustrated with several sets of peptide and DNA promoter data.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on high-dimensional and ultrahigh dimensional multi-category problems and presents a feature selection framework based on local recursive feature elimination (Local-RFE). Using this analytical framework, we propose a new feature selection algorithm, PLS-based local-RFE (LRFE-PLS). In order to compare the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, we also present PLS-based Global-RFE which takes all categories into consideration simultaneously. The advantage of the proposed algorithms lies in the fact that PLS-based feature ranking can quickly delete irrelevant features and RFE can concurrently remove some redundant features. As a result, the selected feature subset is more compact. In this paper the proposed algorithms are compared to some state-of-the-art methods using multiple datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are competitive and work effectively for high-dimensional multi-category data. Statistical tests of significance show that LRFE-PLS algorithm has better performance. The proposed algorithms can be effectively applied not only to microarray data analysis but also to image recognition and financial data analysis.},

	abstract = {Many scientific problems can be formulated as classification tasks. Data that harbor relevant information are usually described by a large number of features. Frequently, many of these features are irrelevant for the class prediction. The efficient implementation of classification models requires identification of suitable combinations of features. The smaller number of features reduces the problem’s dimensionality and may result in higher classification performance. We developed DWFS, a web-based tool that allows for efficient selection of features for a variety of problems. DWFS follows the wrapper paradigm and applies a search strategy based on Genetic Algorithms (GAs). A parallel GA implementation examines and evaluates simultaneously large number of candidate collections of features. DWFS also integrates various filtering methods that may be applied as a pre-processing step in the feature selection process. Furthermore, weights and parameters in the fitness function of GA can be adjusted according to the application requirements. Experiments using heterogeneous datasets from different biomedical applications demonstrate that DWFS is fast and leads to a significant reduction of the number of features without sacrificing performance as compared to several widely used existing methods. DWFS can be accessed online at www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/dwfs.},

	abstract = {Many modern classification and regression models are highly adaptable; they are capable of modeling complex relationships. Each model's adaptability is typically governed by a set of tuning parameters, which can allow each model to pinpoint predictive patterns and structures within the data. However, these tuning parameters can very identify predictive patterns that are not reproducible. This is known as “over-fitting.” Models that are over-fit generally have excellent predictivity for the samples on which they were built, but poor predictivity for new samples. Without a methodological approach to building and evaluating models, the modeler will not know if the model is over-fit until the next set of samples are predicted. In Section 4.1 we use a simple example to illustrate the problem of over-fitting. We then describe a systematic process for tuning models (Section 4.2), which is foundational to the remaining parts of the book. Core to model tuning are appropriate ways for splitting (or spending) the data, which is covered in Section 4.3. Resampling techniques (Section 4.4) are an alternative or complementary approach to data splitting. Recommendations for approaches to data splitting are provided in Section 4.7. After evaluating a number tuning parameters via data splitting or resampling, we must choose the final tuning parameters (Section 4.6). We also discuss how to choose the optimal model across several tuned models (Section 4.8) We illustrate how to implement the recommended techniques discussed in this chapter in the Computing Section (4.9). Exercises are provided at the end of the chapter to solidify concepts.},

To illustrate the impacts and remedies for severe class imbalance, we present a case study example (Section 16.1) and the impact of class imbalance on performances measures (Section 16.2). Sections 16.3-16.6 describe approaches for handling imbalance using the existing data such as maximizing minority class accuracy, adjusting classification cut-offs or prior probabilities, or adjusting sample weights prior to model tuning. Handling imbalance can also be done through sophisticated up- or down-sampling methods (Section 16.7) or by applying costs to the classification errors (Section 16.8).

The case study in the chapter is used to explain the model building process for data that emanate from a designed experiment. In a designed experiment, the predictors and their desired values are prespecified. The specific combinations of the predictor values are also prespecified, which determine the samples that will be collected for the data set. The experiment is then conducted and the response is observed. In the context model building for a designed experiment we present a strategy (Section 10.1), recommendations for evaluating model performance (Section 10.2), an approach for identifying predictor combinations that produce an optimal response (Section 10.3), and syntax for building and evaluating models for this illustration (Section 10.4).},

Ensemble methods combine many trees (or rule-based models) into one model and tend to have much better predictive performance than single tree- or rule-based model.

Preprocessing data is a crucial step prior to modeling since data preparation can make or break a model’s predictive ability. To illustrate general preprocessing techniques, we begin by introducing a cell segmentation data set (Section 3.1). This data set contains common predictor problems such as skewness, outliers, and missing values. Sections 3.2 and 3.3 review predictor transformations for single predictors and multiple predictors, respectively. In Section 3.4 we discuss several approaches for handling missing data. Other preprocessing steps may include removing (Section 3.5), adding (Section 3.6), or binning (Section 3.7) predictors, all of which must be done carefully so that predictive information is not lost or erroneous information is added to the data. The computing section (3.8) provides R syntax for the previously described preprocessing steps. Exercises are provided at the end of the chapter to solidify concepts.},

	abstract = {Feature selection is one of the most fundamental problems in machine learning and has drawn increasing attention due to high-dimensional data sets emerging from different fields like bioinformatics. For feature selection, filter methods play an important role, since they can be combined with any machine learning model and can heavily reduce run time of machine learning algorithms. The aim of the analyses is to review how different filter methods work, to compare their performance with respect to both run time and predictive accuracy, and to provide guidance for applications. Based on 16 high-dimensional classification data sets, 22 filter methods are analyzed with respect to run time and accuracy when combined with a classification method. It is concluded that there is no group of filter methods that always outperforms all other methods, but recommendations on filter methods that perform well on many of the data sets are made. Also, groups of filters that are similar with respect to the order in which they rank the features are found. For the analyses, the R machine learning package mlr is used. It provides a uniform programming API and therefore is a convenient tool to conduct feature selection using filter methods.},

	abstract = {Multivariate Calibration Harald Martens, Chemist, Norwegian Food Research Institute, Aas, Norway and Norwegian Computing Center, Oslo, Norway Tormod Næs, Statistician, Norwegian Food Research Institute, Aas, Norway The aim of this inter-disciplinary book is to present an up-to-date view of multivariate calibration of analytical instruments, for use in research, development and routine laboratory and process operation. The book is intended to show practitioners in chemistry and technology how to extract the quantitative and understandable information embedded in non-selective, overwhelming and apparently useless measurements by multivariate data analysis. Multivariate calibration is the process of learning how to combine data from several channels, in order to overcome selectivity problems, gain new insight and allow automatic outlier detection. Multivariate calibration is the basis for the present success of high-speed Near-Infrared (NIR) diffuse spectroscopy of intact samples. But the technique is very general: it has shown similar advantages in, for instance, UV, Vis, and IR spectrophotometry, (transmittance, reflectance and fluorescence), for x-ray diffraction, NMR, MS, thermal analysis, chromatography (GC, HPLC) and for electrophoresis and image analysis (tomography, microscopy), as well as other techniques. The book is written at two levels: the main level is structured as a tutorial on the practical use of multivariate calibration techniques. It is intended for university courses and self-study for chemists and technologists, giving one complete and versatile approach, based mainly on data compression methodology in self-modelling PLS regression, with considerations of experimental design, data pre-processing and model validation. A second, more methodological, level is intended for statisticians and specialists in chemometrics. It compares several alternative calibration methods, validation approaches and ways to optimize the models. The book also outlines some cognitive changes needed in analytical chemistry, and suggests ways to overcome some communication problems between statistics and chemistry and technology.},

	abstract = {The calving interval (CI) can potentially impact the economic results of dairy farms. This study highlighted the most profitable CI and innovated by describing this optimum as a function of the feeding system of the farm. On-farm data were used to represent real farm conditions. A total of 1832 accounts of farms recorded from 2007 to 2014 provided economic, technical and feeding information per herd and per year. A multiple correspondence analysis created four feeding groups: extensive, low intensive, intensive and very intensive herds. The gross margin and some of its components were corrected to account for the effect of factors external to the farm, such as the market, biological status, etc. Then the corrected gross margin (cGMc) and its components were modelled by CI parameters in each feeding system by use of GLM. The relationship between cGMc and the proportion of cows with CI{\textless}380 days in each feeding group showed that keeping most of the cows in the herd with CI near to 1 year was not profitable for most farms (for the very intensive farms there was no effect of the proportion). Moreover, a low proportion of cows (0\% to 20\%) with a near-to-1-year CI was not profitable for the extensive and low intensive farms. Extending the proportion of cows with CI beyond 459 days until 635 days (i.e. data limitation) caused no significant economic loss for the extensive and low intensive farms, but was not profitable for the intensive and very intensive farms. Variations of the milk and feeding components explained mainly these significant differences of gross margin. A link between the feeding system and persistency, perceptible in the milk production and CI shown by the herd, could explain the different relationships observed between the extent of CI and the economic results in the feeding groups. This herd-level study tended to show different economic optima of CI as a function of the feeding system. A cow-level study would specify these tendencies to give CI objectives to dairy breeders as a function of their farm characteristics.},

	abstract = {The objective of the present study was to evaluate environmental and dam factors associated with birth size of Holstein calves. Data of 1,594 births from dairy herds in Belgium and Germany were analyzed in a retrospective cross-sectional study. Immediately after birth, the birth weight of the calves was measured. On the next day, the heart girth (HG), withers height, and diagonal length of the dams and calves were measured. Parity, body condition score, gestation length (GL), and age at calving were recorded for all dams. For the cows, days open, lactation length, length of the dry period, and calving interval were also calculated. The magnitude and shape of the lactation that took place during gestation was quantified using the MilkBot model based on monthly milk weights. Using the same procedure, cumulative milk production from conception to drying off (MGEST) was calculated. After descriptive analyses, mixed models were used to identify factors that are significantly associated with the birth weight (most consistent measure of size at birth) of the calves born to both heifers and cows. Of the variables offered to the offspring birth weight model in heifers (n=540), calf sex, season of calving, GL, HG, withers height, diagonal length, and age at calving were significant. The mean birth weight of the calves born to heifers was estimated to be 41.3±1.01kg. In comparison to calves born to old (25.5 to 37.3mo; n=99) heifers, the birth weight was estimated to be 2.75, 3.29, and 2.35kg heavier when the calves were born to very young (20.3 to {\textless}22mo; n=98), young (22 to {\textless}23.5mo; n=145), and standard aged (23.5 to {\textless}25.5mo; n=198) heifers, respectively. Of the variables offered to the offspring birth weight model in cows (n=1,054), calf sex, season of calving, GL, parity, dry period, and MGEST were significant. The mean birth weight of the calves born to cows was estimated to be 44.1±0.99kg. For cows having an identical HG, the birth weight of the calves was estimated to be 0.97 and 1.11kg higher in cows with low (1,400 to {\textless}5,400kg) and high (6,500 to {\textless}7,200) MGEST, respectively, compared with cows with very high (7,200 to 11,600kg) MGEST. The decisive effects of age at calving in heifers and of high milk production levels during gestation in cows on the birth weight of their calves may provide a basis for developing managerial interventions to improve long-term health and productivity of the offspring.},

	abstract = {Both blood- and milk-based biomarkers have been analysed for decades in research settings, although often only in one herd, and without focus on the variation in the biomarkers that are specifically related to herd or diet. Biomarkers can be used to detect physiological imbalance and disease risk and may have a role in precision livestock farming (PLF). For use in PLF, it is important to quantify normal variation in specific biomarkers and the source of this variation. The objective of this study was to estimate the between- and within-herd variation in a number of blood metabolites (β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), non-esterified fatty acids, glucose and serum IGF-1), milk metabolites (free glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, urea, isocitrate, BHB and uric acid), milk enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase)) and composite indicators for metabolic imbalances (Physiological Imbalance-index and energy balance), to help facilitate their adoption within PLF. Blood and milk were sampled from 234 Holstein dairy cows from 6 experimental herds, each in a different European country, and offered a total of 10 different diets. Blood was sampled on 2 occasions at approximately 14 days-in-milk (DIM) and 35 DIM. Milk samples were collected twice weekly (in total 2750 samples) from DIM 1 to 50. Multilevel random regression models were used to estimate the variance components and to calculate the intraclass correlations (ICCs). The ICCs for the milk metabolites, when adjusted for parity and DIM at sampling, demonstrated that between 12\% (glucose-6-phosphate) and 46\% (urea) of the variation in the metabolites’ levels could be associated with the herd-diet combination. Intraclass Correlations related to the herd-diet combination were generally higher for blood metabolites, from 17\% (cholesterol) to approximately 46\% (BHB and urea). The high ICCs for urea suggest that this biomarker can be used for monitoring on herd level. The low variance within cow for NAGase indicates that few samples would be needed to describe the status and potentially a general reference value could be used. The low ICC for most of the biomarkers and larger within cow variation emphasises that multiple samples would be needed - most likely on the individual cows - for making the biomarkers useful for monitoring. The majority of biomarkers were influenced by parity and DIM which indicate that these should be accounted for if the biomarker should be used for monitoring.},

	abstract = {The goal of this study was to find a procedure to standardize dairy milk mid-infrared spectra from different Fourier transform mid-infrared spectrophotometers (different brands or models) inside a European dairy network to create new farm-management indicators (e.g., fertility, health, feed, environmental impact) based on milk infrared spectra. This step is necessary to create common spectral databases, allowing the building of statistical tools, to be used by all instruments of the network. The method used was piecewise direct standardization (PDS), which matches slave-instrument spectra on master-instrument spectra. To evaluate the possibility of using common equations on different instruments, the PDS method was tested on a set of milk samples measured on each machine, and an equation predicting fat content of milk is applied on all. Regressions were performed between master and slaves fat predictions, before and after PDS. Bias and root mean square error between predictions were decreased after PDS, respectively, from 0.3781 to 0.0000 and from 0.4609 to 0.0156 (g of fat/100mL of milk). The stability over time of these results was confirmed by an application of the coefficients created by PDS 1 mo later on the slave spectra. These preliminary results showed that the PDS method permits a reduction of the inherent spectral variability between instruments, allowing the merging of Fourier transform mid-infrared milk spectra from different instruments into a common database, the creation of new types of dairy farm management indicators, and the use of these common calibrations for all Fourier transform mid-infrared instruments of the European dairy network.},

	abstract = {An increasing number of models are being developed to provide information from milk Fourier transform mid-infrared (FT-MIR) spectra on fine milk composition, technological properties of milk, or even cows' physiological status. In this context, and to take advantage of these existing models, the purpose of this work was to evaluate whether a spectral standardization method can enable the use of multiple equations within a network of different FT-MIR spectrometers. The piecewise direct standardization method was used, matching “slave” instruments to a common reference, the “master.” The effect of standardization on network reproducibility was assessed on 66 instruments from 3 different brands by comparing the spectral variability of the slaves and the master with and without standardization. With standardization, the global Mahalanobis distance from the slave spectra to the master spectra was reduced on average from 2,655.9 to 14.3, representing a significant reduction of noninformative spectral variability. The transfer of models from instrument to instrument was tested using 3 FT-MIR models predicting (1) the quantity of daily methane emitted by dairy cows, (2) the concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids in milk, and (3) the fresh cheese yield. The differences, in terms of root mean squared error, between master predictions and slave predictions were reduced after standardization on average from 103 to 17 g/d, from 0.0315 to 0.0045 g/100 mL of milk, and from 2.55 to 0.49 g of curd/100 g of milk, respectively. For all the models, standard deviations of predictions among all the instruments were also reduced by 5.11 times for methane, 5.01 times for polyunsaturated fatty acids, and 7.05 times for fresh cheese yield, showing an improvement of prediction reproducibility within the network. Regarding the results obtained, spectral standardization allows the transfer and use of multiple models on all instruments as well as the improvement of spectral and prediction reproducibility within the network. The method makes the models universal, thereby offering opportunities for data exchange and the creation and use of common robust models at an international level to provide more information to the dairy sector from direct analysis of milk.},

	abstract = {To manage negative energy balance and ketosis in dairy farms, rapid and cost-effective detection is needed. Among the milk biomarkers that could be useful for this purpose, acetone and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) have been proved as molecules of interest regarding ketosis and citrate was recently identified as an early indicator of negative energy balance. Because Fourier transform mid-infrared spectrometry can provide rapid and cost-effective predictions of milk composition, the objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of this technology to predict these biomarkers in milk. Milk samples were collected in commercial and experimental farms in Luxembourg, France, and Germany. Acetone, BHB, and citrate contents were determined by flow injection analysis. Milk mid-infrared spectra were recorded and standardized for all samples. After edits, a total of 548 samples were used in the calibration and validation data sets for acetone, 558 for BHB, and 506 for citrate. Acetone content ranged from 0.020 to 3.355mmol/L with an average of 0.103mmol/L; BHB content ranged from 0.045 to 1.596mmol/L with an average of 0.215mmol/L; and citrate content ranged from 3.88 to 16.12mmol/L with an average of 9.04mmol/L. Acetone and BHB contents were log-transformed and a part of the samples with low values was randomly excluded to approach a normal distribution. The 3 edited data sets were then randomly divided into a calibration data set (3/4 of the samples) and a validation data set (1/4 of the samples). Prediction equations were developed using partial least square regression. The coefficient of determination (R2) of cross-validation was 0.73 for acetone, 0.71 for BHB, and 0.90 for citrate with root mean square error of 0.248, 0.109, and 0.70mmol/L, respectively. Finally, the external validation was performed and R2 obtained were 0.67 for acetone, 0.63 for BHB, and 0.86 for citrate, with respective root mean square error of validation of 0.196, 0.083, and 0.76mmol/L. Although the practical usefulness of the equations developed should be further verified with other field data, results from this study demonstrated the potential of Fourier transform mid-infrared spectrometry to predict citrate content with good accuracy and to supply indicative contents of BHB and acetone in milk, thereby providing rapid and cost-effective tools to manage ketosis and negative energy balance in dairy farms.},

	abstract = {PLS-regression (PLSR) is the PLS approach in its simplest, and in chemistry and technology, most used form (two-block predictive PLS). PLSR is a method for relating two data matrices, X and Y, by a linear multivariate model, but goes beyond traditional regression in that it models also the structure of X and Y. PLSR derives its usefulness from its ability to analyze data with many, noisy, collinear, and even incomplete variables in both X and Y. PLSR has the desirable property that the precision of the model parameters improves with the increasing number of relevant variables and observations. This article reviews PLSR as it has developed to become a standard tool in chemometrics and used in chemistry and engineering. The underlying model and its assumptions are discussed, and commonly used diagnostics are reviewed together with the interpretation of resulting parameters. Two examples are used as illustrations: First, a Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR)/Quantitative Structure–Property Relationship (QSPR) data set of peptides is used to outline how to develop, interpret and refine a PLSR model. Second, a data set from the manufacturing of recycled paper is analyzed to illustrate time series modelling of process data by means of PLSR and time-lagged X-variables.},

Background: In genomics, a commonly encountered problem is to extract a subset of variables out of a large set of explanatory variables associated with one or several quantitative or qualitative response variables. An example is to identify associations between codon-usage and phylogeny based definitions of taxonomic groups at different taxonomic levels. Maximum understandability with the smallest number of selected variables, consistency of the selected variables, as well as variation of model performance on test data, are issues to be addressed for such problems.
Results: We present an algorithm balancing the parsimony and the predictive performance of a model. The algorithm is based on variable selection using reduced-rank Partial Least Squares with a regularized elimination. Allowing a marginal decrease in model performance results in a substantial decrease in the number of selected variables. This significantly improves the understandability of the model. Within the approach we have tested and compared three different criteria commonly used in the Partial Least Square modeling paradigm for variable selection; loading weights, regression coefficients and variable importance on projections. The algorithm is applied to a problem of identifying codon variations discriminating different bacterial taxa, which is of particular interest in classifying metagenomics samples. The results are compared with a classical forward selection algorithm, the much used Lasso algorithm as well as Soft-threshold Partial Least Squares variable selection.
Conclusions: A regularized elimination algorithm based on Partial Least Squares produces results that increase understandability and consistency and reduces the classification error on test data compared to standard approaches.},

The ‘lasso’ minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

	abstract = {Greenhouse gases originating from the dairy sector, including methane (CH4), contribute to global warming. A possible strategy to reduce CH4 production is to use genetic selection. This requires genetic parameters for CH4 production and correlations with production traits. Data were available on 184 Holstein-Friesian cows. Methane production was measured in the milking robot during milking from December 2009 to April 2010. In total 2,456 observations for CH4 production were available. Milk yield (MY) and body weight (BW) were obtained at every milking from November 2008 to October 2010. In total 4,567 observations for milk yield and 4,570 observations for BW were available. Restricted maximum likelihood, using random regression models, was used to analyze the data. Heritability (standard error given in parentheses) for CH4 production ranged from 0.12 (0.16) to 0.45 (0.11), and genetic correlations with MY ranged from 0.49 (0.12) to 0.54 (0.26). The positive genetic correlation between CH4 production and milk yield indicates that care needs to be taken when genetically selecting for lower CH4 production, to avoid a decrease in MY at the animal level. However, this study shows that CH4 production is moderately heritable and therefore progress through genetic selection is possible.},

	abstract = {Microarray gene expression data gained great importance in recent years due to its role in disease diagnoses and prognoses which help to choose the appropriate treatment plan for patients. This technology has shifted a new era in molecular classification. Interpreting gene expression data remains a difficult problem and an active research area due to their native nature of “high dimensional low sample size”. Such problems pose great challenges to existing classification methods. Thus, effective feature selection techniques are often needed in this case to aid to correctly classify different tumor types and consequently lead to a better understanding of genetic signatures as well as improve treatment strategies. This paper aims on a comparative study of state-of-the- art feature selection methods, classification methods, and the combination of them, based on gene expression data. We compared the efficiency of three different classification methods including: support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor and random forest, and eight different feature selection methods, including: information gain, twoing rule, sum minority, max minority, gini index, sum of variances, t-statistics, and one-dimension support vector machine. Five-fold cross validation was used to evaluate the classification performance. Two publicly available gene expression data sets of glioma were used in the experiments. Results revealed the important role of feature selection in classifying gene expression data. By performing feature selection, the classification accuracy can be significantly boosted by using a small number of genes. The relationship of features selected in different feature selection methods is investigated and the most frequent features selected in each fold among all methods for both datasets are evaluated.},

	abstract = {Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been extensively used in classification problems because it is fast, reliable, cost-effective, and non-destructive. However, NIR data often have several hundred or thousand variables (wavelengths) that are highly correlated with each other. Thus, it is critical to select a few important features or wavelengths that better explain NIR data. Wavelets are popular as preprocessing tools for spectra data. Many applications perform feature selection directly, based on high-dimensional wavelet coefficients, and this can be computationally expensive. This paper proposes a two-stage scheme for the classification of NIR spectra data. In the first stage, the proposed multi-scale vertical energy thresholding procedure is used to reduce the dimension of the high-dimensional spectral data. In the second stage, a few important wavelet coefficients are selected using the proposed support vector machines gradient-recursive feature elimination. The proposed two-stage method has produced better classification performance, with higher computational efficiency, when tested on four NIR data sets.},

In the first stage, binary subsets between samples originating from diseased and non-diseased cattle are defined along known covariates within the data set. Random forests are then used to select spectral channels on each subset, on the basis of a multivariate measure of variable importance, the Gini importance. The selected features are then used to establish binary discriminations within each subset by means of ridge regression. In the second stage of the hierarchical procedure the predictions from all linear classifiers are used as input to another random forest that provides the final classification. When applied to an independent, blinded validation set of 160 further spectra (84 BSE-positives, 76 BSE-negatives), the hierarchical classifier achieves a sensitivity of 92\% and a specificity of 95\%. Compared with results from an earlier study based on the same data, the hierarchical scheme performs better than linear discriminant analysis with features selected by genetic optimization and robust linear discriminant analysis, and performs as well as a neural network and a support vector machine.

The selection of a smaller number of variables prior to sample classification is a widespread task in many research studies, where attempts are made to seek the lowest possible set of variables that are still able to achieve a high level of prediction accuracy; in other words, there is a need to generate the most parsimonious solution when the number of input variables is huge but the number of samples/objects are smaller. Here, we compare several different variable selection approaches in order to ascertain which of these are ideally suited to achieve this goal. All variable selection approaches were applied to the analysis of a common set of metabolomics data generated by Curie-point pyrolysis mass spectrometry (Py-MS), where the goal of the study was to classify the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus. These approaches include stepwise forward variable selection, used for linear discriminant analysis (LDA); variable importance for projection (VIP) coefficient, employed in partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA); support vector machines-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE); as well as the mean decrease in accuracy and mean decrease in Gini, provided by random forests (RF). Finally, a double cross-validation procedure was applied to minimize the consequence of overfitting. The results revealed that RF with its variable selection techniques and SVM combined with SVM-RFE as a variable selection method, displayed the best results in comparison to other approaches.},

Background: Regularized regression methods such as principal component or partial least squares regression perform well in learning tasks on high dimensional spectral data, but cannot explicitly eliminate irrelevant features. The random forest classifier with its associated Gini feature importance, on the other hand, allows for an explicit feature elimination, but may not be optimally adapted to spectral data due to the topology of its constituent classification trees which are based on orthogonal splits in feature space.
Results: We propose to combine the best of both approaches, and evaluated the joint use of a feature selection based on a recursive feature elimination using the Gini importance of random forests' together with regularized classification methods on spectral data sets from medical diagnostics, chemotaxonomy, biomedical analytics, food science, and synthetically modified spectral data. Here, a feature selection using the Gini feature importance with a regularized classification by discriminant partial least squares regression performed as well as or better than a filtering according to different univariate statistical tests, or using regression coefficients in a backward feature elimination. It outperformed the direct application of the random forest classifier, or the direct application of the regularized classifiers on the full set of features.
Conclusion: The Gini importance of the random forest provided superior means for measuring feature relevance on spectral data, but - on an optimal subset of features - the regularized classifiers might be preferable over the random forest classifier, in spite of their limitation to model linear dependencies only. A feature selection based on Gini importance, however, may precede a regularized linear classification to identify this optimal subset of features, and to earn a double benefit of both dimensionality reduction and the elimination of noise from the classification task.},

The current work aimed to validate the feasibility of predicting BW using the day in milk, parity, milk yield, and milk mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum from a multiple-country dataset and reduce the number of predictors to limit the risk of over-fitting and potentially improve its accuracy. The BW modeling procedure involved feature selections and herd-independent validation in identifying the most interesting subsets of predictors and then external validation of the models. From 1849 records collected in 9 herds from 360 Holstein cows, the best performing models achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) for the herd-independent validation between 52 ± 2.34 kg to 56 ± 3.16 kg, including from 5 to 62 predictors. Among these models, three performed remarkably well in external validation using an independent dataset (N = 4067), resulting in RMSE ranging from 52 to 56 kg. The results suggest that multiple optimal BW predictive models coexist due to the high correlations between adjacent spectral points.},
